# Get started with Grafana Cloud k6

Follow along to learn how to create load tests with the _Test Builder_.

## Before you start

To do these procedures, you'll need the following:

- [ ] A [Grafana Cloud](/docs/grafana-cloud/) instance with the k6 app

## Create a test with the test builder

The _Test Builder_ is a graphical interface to simulate user behavior and model traffic patterns.
It provides a quick way to prototype tests and learn the basic functionality of the k6 API.

You have permission to run load tests on a demo site, `https://test.k6.io`.
To learn how to make a test, follow these steps:

1. From your Grafana instance, go to the k6 app.
1. Select **New Test**. Choose the **Test Builder**.
1. In the first field, name the test `Test demo`.
1. Select **Request**.
1. Make your test logic:
    - In the **Name** field, enter `Get homepage`.
    - In the **Request** fields, select `GET` and enter the url, `test.k6.io`.

Now you have test logic, and could already run a test.
But k6 doesn't only make requests.
It also models _load_, or traffic patterns.
These load patterns are modeled in test _scenarios_.

Configure your scenario to model 10 users trying to access the homepage 100 times.

1. In **Scenarios**, select **Options**. 
1. In **Executor**, select `Shared iterations`.
1. Enter the following load pattern:

    |                |      |
    |----------------|------|
    | **VUS**        | `10` |
    | **Iterations** | `100` |
   
1. **Run test**.

You just started your first load test!
The app presents the results in near real time,
and when it finishes you can look at granular data for all results output.

## Model ramping traffic from multiple geographies

This procedure modifies the same test for ramping traffic and multiple load zones.
In real life, load comes from multiple locations and request rates change over the course of a day.
The k6 app provides many options to better approximate real-world load.

To configure the test for ramping logic, follow these steps:

1. Go to the k6 App and select your test. 
1. **Configure**. 
1. Under **Scenarios**, select **Options**.
1. To configure a ramping  load, for **Executor**, select `Ramping VUs`
1. Leave the default values for **Target VUs** and **Duration**

    | Target VUs | Duration |
    |------------|----------|
    | 20         | 1m       |
    | 20         | 3m30s    |
    | 0          | 1m       |

This load configuration starts with 0 virtual users, ramps up to 20 over a minute minute, remains at this level for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, then ramps back down to 0.

Now, distribute the geography of the load with these steps:

1. Go to **Options > Load zones**.
1. Keep `Ashburn, US` as the first option.
1. Press **Add new load zone** and select `London, GB`. Repeat the process with `Sydney, AU`.

To run a test with ramping load from three different continents, **Save and Run**.

As the test runs, a panel shows values for request rate (traffic), response time (latency), and error rate (availabilty).

Can you find any relationships between these values?
If not, you can try increasing the target VUs until something interesting happens.

## Run test script on the CLI

k6 tests are designed to be portable.
Each test you make in the Test Builder has an underlying test script.

You can run the same script on your local machine.
To do so, follow these steps:

1. From the test results, select **Script**.
1. Select **Run script from the CLI** and follow the instructions.

As you build the test, you can also use the **Script** toggle to view the configuration.
