# This workflow keeps the list of extensions up to date
# in the docs/sources/next/extensions/explore.md file.
#
# The workflow is activated by a workflow dispatch event
# of the "extension-registry-changed" type.
# This event is triggered by the grafana/k6-extension-registry
# repository when the extension registry changes.
#
# The list of extensions is generated based on https://registry.k6.io/registry.json.
# If the generated list differs from the previous one,
# it is pushed to the "extension-registry-changed" branch and
# a pull request is created with the change (or updated if it already existed).
#
# It is not a problem if the registry changes several times before merging the pull request,
# the pull request will be updated. The "extension-registry-changed" branch can be deleted
# after merging the pull request, it will be created again if necessary.
