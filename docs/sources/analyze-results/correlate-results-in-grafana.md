# Correlate results in Grafana

A unique advantage of combining k6 with Grafana is that you can compare data from both sides of the test―server-side and client-side metrics―in one place. Add test results data to your Grafana dashboards for easy correlation between test results and other system metrics.

Placing your test results alongside other panels can be a powerful tool for test analysis.
For example, you could compare CPU utilization with built-in [k6 HTTP metrics](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/metrics) such as:

- `http_reqs`, to measure traffic arrival in requests
- `http_req_duration`, to measure latency in request duration
- `http_req_failed`, to measure availability in terms of successful requests.

Thus, with only four measurements, you could graphically explore the relationships between something like the [four golden signals](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals).

## Explore

Use [Grafana Explore](/docs/grafana/latest/explore/) to query metrics and show test results as graph and a table. You can query distinct data types from multiple sources and visualize them together for comparison and correlation.

To work directly with the k6 queries of a panel on Explore:

1. Navigate to a test result view.
1. Find a panel to query their metrics.
1. Click the actions menu (three dots).

	![Select Explore metrics](/media/docs/k6/screenshot-grafana-cloud-kebab-menu.png)

1. Click **Explore**.

	Explore displays the metric or group of metrics.

## Add a panel for the k6 data source

To add k6 metrics as a panel, follow these steps:

1. Open the dashboard that you want to add the panel to.
1. At the top of the dashboard, click **Add** and select **Visualization**.
1. For **Data source**, choose `k6`.
1. Filter for your **Test**, **Test run**, **Project**, and **Query type**.
1. **Save**.

## Copy a k6 panel to a dashboard

Add a k6 panel to a [dashboard](/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/) when you want to visualize k6 results with other existing visualizations, such as observability data of the system under test. 

1. Find the k6 panel.
1. Click the **Kebab menu** (three dots).
1. Click **Copy to Clipboard**.
1. Navigate to the dashboard that you want to add the panel.
1. At the top of the dashboard, click **Add** and select **Paste panel**.

Once added the k6 panel to a dashboard, you can edit the panel options. 

### Change the panel visualization

To change the panel visualization:

1. Hover over any part of the panel to display the actions menu (three dots) on the top right corner. 
1. Click the menu and select **Edit**.  
1. Click the name of the current visualization to see a list of all visualizations, and select the one you want.

The majority of the k6 panels are `Time series` visualizations.
For details, refer to [query types]({{< relref "../reference/query-types" >}}).
