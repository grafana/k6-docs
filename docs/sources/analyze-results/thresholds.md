With thresholds, you can set pass/fail criteria for your test metrics.
Often testers use thresholds to codify their service-level objectives.

> **â“˜ If a threshold fails, k6 marks the test as `Failed` in the UI.**

## Pass/Fail criteria in a test

By analyzing your threshold data, you can discover whether your test passed or failed the metric objectives that you set.

If a threshold fails, you can use the **Thresholds** tab to analyze its trends across the test duration and iterations.

## Explore thresholds in Grafana Cloud k6

To visually inspect and analyze thresholds, use the **Threshold** tab.

First, in the tab itself, note the number of the thresholds that passed against the total number of thresholds.
This number can let you know whether the tab is worth exploring.

Then, you can explore the data from individual thresholds.
You can use this tab to do the following investigations.

To find failing thresholds, use the search bar. You can filter by name or by pass/fail status.

1. Search for one or multiple names, like `http` or `vus`.
1. From your filters, find which thresholds. For example, `vus: value>100` and `http_reqs:count>10000`.

   Note the <span style="color:RGB(209, 122, 14)">red</span> or <span style="color:RGB(26, 127, 75)">green</span> markings on the left side of each row.


To **see visualizations for the metric**, select the threshold.
1. Use the graph to inspect when performance degraded.

  In our example below, the expanded threshold has a value below the threshold of 500 ms.
