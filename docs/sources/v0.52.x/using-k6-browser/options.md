# Browser options

You can customize the behavior of the browser module by providing browser options as environment variables.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}

Customizing browser options via environment variables is unsupported when [running browser tests in Grafana Cloud k6](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/k6/get-started/run-your-first-browser-tests/).

The following command passes the browser options as environment variables to launch a headful browser with custom arguments.

```bash
$ K6_BROWSER_HEADLESS=false K6_BROWSER_ARGS='show-property-changed-rects' k6 run script.js
```

```docker
# WARNING!
# The grafana/k6:master-with-browser image launches a Chrome browser by setting the
# 'no-sandbox' argument. Only use it with trustworthy websites.
#
# As an alternative, you can use a Docker SECCOMP profile instead, and overwrite the
# Chrome arguments to not use 'no-sandbox' such as:

## Default arguments

List of default arguments included when launching the browser process. You can pass one or more of the arguments to the `K6_BROWSER_IGNORE_DEFAULT_ARGS` environment variable when starting a test for the ones you want to ignore.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}

The starting '--' have been omitted from the argument names in these lists.
