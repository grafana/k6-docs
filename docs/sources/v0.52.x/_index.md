## Overview

Using k6, you can test the reliability and performance of your application and infrastructure.

k6 helps engineering teams prevent errors and SLO breaches, enabling them to build resilient and high-performing applications that scale.

Engineering teams, including Developers, QA Engineers, SDETs, and SREs, commonly use k6 for:

- **Load and performance testing**

  k6 is optimized for minimal resource consumption and designed for running high-load performance tests such as
  [spike](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/test-types/spike-testing), [stress](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/test-types/stress-testing), or [soak tests](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/test-types/soak-testing).

- **Browser performance testing**

  Through the [k6 browser API](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6-browser), you can run browser-based performance tests and collect browser metrics to identify performance issues related to browsers. Additionally, you can mix browser tests with other performance tests to get a comprehensive view of your website's performance.

- **Performance and synthetic monitoring**

  You can schedule tests to run with minimal load very frequently, continuously validating the performance and availability of your production environment. For this, you can also use [Grafana Cloud Synthetic Monitoring](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/synthetic-monitoring/create-checks/checks/k6/), which supports running k6 scripts.

- **Automation of performance tests**

  k6 integrates seamlessly with CI/CD and automation tools, enabling engineering teams to [automate performance testing](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/automated-performance-testing/) as part of their development and release cycle.

- **Chaos and resilience testing**

  You can use k6 to simulate traffic as part of your chaos experiments, trigger them from your k6 tests or inject different types of faults in Kubernetes with [xk6-disruptor](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/injecting-faults-with-xk6-disruptor/xk6-disruptor).

- **Infrastructure testing**

  With [k6 extensions](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/extensions/), you can add support to k6 for new protocols or use a particular client to directly test individual systems within your infrastructure.
