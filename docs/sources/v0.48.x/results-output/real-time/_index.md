# Real time

Besides the [end-of-test summary](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/results-output/end-of-test), you can also view metrics as granular data points.
k6 can stream the metrics in real-time and either:

- Write output to a file
- Send output to an external service.

## Write to file {#write}

Currently, k6 supports writing to the following file formats:

- [CSV](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/results-output/real-time/csv)
- [JSON](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/results-output/real-time/json)

## Stream to service {#service}

You can also stream real-time metrics to:

- [Grafana Cloud k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/results-output/real-time/cloud)

As well as the following third-party services:
