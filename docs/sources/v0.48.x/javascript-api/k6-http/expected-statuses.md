### Example

{{< code >}}

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';

// setting some pretty strange status codes as expected
http.setResponseCallback(http.expectedStatuses(406, 500, { min: 200, max: 204 }, 302, { min: 305, max: 405 }));

export default () => {
  // this one will actually be marked as failed as it doesn't match any of the above listed status
  // codes
  http.get('https://httpbin.test.k6.io/status/205');
};
```
