# IntelliSense

[IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) refers to code editing features like **intelligent code completion** and **quick access to documentation**. These features can significantly improve the developer experience and productivity when working on k6 scripts in your editor of choice. Notable features are:

- Auto-completion of k6 functions, methods, and classes.
- Auto imports of k6 modules.
- Access to k6 documentation when writing and hovering code.

## VS Code & IntelliJ

k6 has its [TypeScript Type Definition](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/k6) that you can configure with your editor to unlock code editing features.

In Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, you can configure IntelliSense to recognize the [k6 JavaScript API](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/javascript-api) by installing the k6 Types with a package manager.

```bash
# create a `package.json` file
$ npm init --yes

# install the k6 types as dev dependency
$ npm install --save-dev @types/k6
```
