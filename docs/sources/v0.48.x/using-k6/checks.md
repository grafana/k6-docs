# Checks

Checks validate boolean conditions in your test.
Testers often use checks to validate that the system is responding with the expected content.
For example, a check could validate that a POST request has a `response.status == 201`, or that the body is of a certain size.

Checks are similar to what many testing frameworks call an _assert_, but **failed checks do not cause the test to abort or finish with a failed status**.
Instead, k6 keeps track of the rate of failed checks as the test continues to run

Each check creates a [rate metric](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/metrics).
To make a check abort or fail a test, you can combine it with a [Threshold](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/thresholds).

## Check for HTTP response code

Checks are great for codifying assertions relating to HTTP requests and responses.
For example, this snippet makes sure the HTTP response code is a 200:

{{< code >}}

```javascript
import { check } from 'k6';
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://test.k6.io/');
  check(res, {
    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
  });
}
```

{{< /code >}}

## Check for text in response body

Sometimes, even an HTTP 200 response contains an error message.
In these situations, consider adding a check to verify the response body, like this:

{{< code >}}

```javascript
import { check } from 'k6';
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://test.k6.io/');
  check(res, {
    'verify homepage text': (r) => r.body.includes('Collection of simple web-pages suitable for load testing'),
  });
}
```

{{< /code >}}

## Check for response body size

To verify the size of the response body, you can use a check like this:

{{< code >}}

```javascript
import { check } from 'k6';
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://test.k6.io/');
  check(res, {
    'body size is 11,105 bytes': (r) => r.body.length == 11105,
  });
}
```

{{< /code >}}

## See percentage of checks that passed

When a script includes checks, the summary report shows how many of the tests' checks passed:

{{< code >}}

```bash
$ k6 run script.js

  ...
    ✓ is status 200

  ...
  checks.........................: 100.00% ✓ 1        ✗ 0
  data_received..................: 11 kB   12 kB/s
```

{{< /code >}}

In this example, note that the check "is status 200" succeeded 100% of the times it was called.

## Add multiple checks

You can also add multiple checks within a single [check()](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/javascript-api/k6/check) statement:

{{< code >}}

```javascript
import { check } from 'k6';
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://test.k6.io/');
  check(res, {
    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'body size is 11,105 bytes': (r) => r.body.length == 11105,
  });
}
```

{{< /code >}}

When this test executes, the output will look something like this:

{{< code >}}

```bash
$ k6 run checks.js

  ...
    ✓ is status 200
    ✓ body size is 11,105 bytes

  ...
  checks.........................: 100.00% ✓ 2        ✗ 0
  data_received..................: 11 kB   20 kB/s
```

{{< /code >}}

{{% admonition type="note" %}}

When a check fails, the script will continue executing successfully and will not return a 'failed' exit status. 
If you need the whole test to fail based on the results of a check, you have to [combine checks with thresholds](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/thresholds#fail-a-load-test-using-checks).
This is particularly useful in specific contexts, such as integrating k6 into your CI pipelines or receiving alerts when scheduling your performance tests.
