# Results output

As k6 generates load for your test, it also makes _metrics_ that measure the performance of the system.
Broadly, you can analyze metrics in two ways:

- As summary statistics, in an _end-of-test_ summary report.
- In granular detail, with measurements for every data point across test (and timestamps)

You can customize almost every aspect of result output:

- Create custom metrics
- Configure new summary statistics and print them to any text format.
- Stream the results to one or multiple services of your choice (for example, InfluxDB or Prometheus).

## Metrics

**Documentation**: [Using metrics](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/metrics)

k6 comes with built-in metrics about the test load and the system response.
Key metrics include:

- `http_req_duration`, the end-to-end time of all requests (that is, the total latency)
- `http_req_failed`, the total number of failed requests
- `iterations`, the total number of iterations

## End-of-test summary

**Documentation**: [End-of-test summary](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/results-output/end-of-test)

By default, k6 prints summarized results to `stdout`.

When you run a test, k6 outputs a plain-text logo, your test progress, and some test details.
After the test finishes, k6 prints the full details and summary statistics of the test metrics.

The end-of-test summary shows aggregated statistical values for your result metrics, including:

- Median and average values
- Minimum and maximum values
- p90, p95, and p99 values

You can configure the statistics to report with the [`--summary-trend-stats`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/k6-options/reference#summary-trend-stats) option.
For example, this command displays only median, p95, and p99.9 values.

```sh
k6 run --iterations=100 --vus=10 \
--summary-trend-stats="med,p(95),p(99.9)" script.js
```

### Custom reports with `handleSummary()`

For completely customized end-of-summary reports, k6 provides the `handleSummary()` function.

At the end of the test, k6 automatically creates an object with all aggregated statistics.
The `handleSummary()` function can process this object into a custom report in any text format: JSON, HTML, XML, and whatever else.

## Time series and external outputs

**Documentation**: [Real-time metrics](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/results-output/real-time)

The condensed end-of-test summary provides a top-level view of the test.
For deeper analysis, you need to look at granular time-series data,
which has metrics and timestamps for every point of the test.

You can access time-series metrics in two ways:

- Write them to a JSON or CSV file.
- Stream them to an external service.

In both cases, you can use the `--out` flag and declare your export format as the flag argument.
If you want to send the metrics to multiple sources, you can use multiple flags with multiple arguments:

```sh
k6 run \
--out json=test.json \
--out influxdb=http://localhost:8086/k6
```
