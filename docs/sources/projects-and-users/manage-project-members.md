# Manage project members

A k6 project member is a Grafana user with access to a particular [k6 project]({{< relref "./projects" >}}). Each member is associated with a role that includes permissions in the project.

## Roles

Grafana Cloud k6 uses the following roles to control user access:

- **Admin**: Has access to all the resources. 
- **Editor**: Can create and run tests.
- **Viewer**: Can only view tests.

## Grant member roles

### Before you begin

- Ensure that you are an admin of the k6 project
- The new project member must be a Grafana organization member and have logged into the Grafana Stack of the k6 project

To grant a role to a team member in a k6 project:
1. Click **Projects** on the k6 sidebar.
2. Click the **Project Settings** (gear) icon of the particular project.
3. Click the **Add users** button.
4. In the **Email address** field, locate and select a user.
5. In the **Role** field, select a role.
6. Click the **Add users** button.

The following example shows a list as it appears to an admin.

In this view, you can remove a user from the project or change their role.
