# Projects

Projects allow to organize k6 tests in collections and grant their access. Here are some ways we users use Projects to stay organized:

- Per team: Each team is given their own project for them to do their work and collaborate.
- Per component: A project is created for each component or service you're testing.
- Per brand: E-commerce customers may want to use projects per brand to stay organized.
- Per customer: When dealing with custom software, you can to organize by customer to ensure each unique system is tested.
- Per major release: After your systems go through a major change, you can to create a new project to organize the most recent data.

> To invite users to a project, refer to [manage project members]({{< relref "./manage-project-members" >}}).


## Running CLI Tests in a Specific Project

By default, when you run a test from the CLI, the test runs in your default project. If you want to set the test run in a different project, specify the [`projectID` option]({{< relref "../author-run/cloud-scripting-extras/cloud-options" >}}) in the k6 script:

```javascript
export const options = {
  ext: {
    loadimpact: {
      projectID: 3479144,
    },
  },
};
```

In Grafana Cloud, you can find the `projectID` value below the project name on the project view:
