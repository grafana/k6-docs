## Usage reports

The *Usage report* helps you keep track of everything happening in your teamâ€™s project and follow the activity of your performance testing projects.

To view the Usage report, go to  **Manage > Usage reports** section.

> The usage report view is currently not available in Grafana Cloud. We are working on it.
> 
> Meanwhile, the Usage reports option redirects you to [k6 Cloud (app.k6.io)](https://app.k6.io/) to access from there.
