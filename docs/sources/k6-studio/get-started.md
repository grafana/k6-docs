# Get started

This tutorial shows how to create a recording, set up custom rules, and generate a test script using k6 Studio.

In this tutorial, you will:

- Create a test recording using the https://test-api.k6.io/ service.
- Learn how to create groups to organize your test recordings.
- View the request and response data from a test recording.
- Use the Test Generator to create a correlation and a custom code rule.
- Validate your test script from the Test Generator.
- Export your test script.

## Before you begin

## Summary

To summarize:

- You created a test recording using the https://test-api.k6.io/ service.
- You created groups to organize a test recording into logical steps.
- You learned how to view request and response data from a test recording.
- You created a Test Generator from a test recording, and learned how to use the correlation and custom code rules.
- You learned how to validate a test script after setting up rules in the Test Generator.
- You exported a test script from your test recording and rules setup.

Now you can use the same steps to create a test recording for an application or service that you own and generate test scripts. You can then use those scripts to run performance tests by using the k6 CLI, or Grafana Cloud k6.

## Next steps

Now that you learned the basics of how to use k6 Studio, you can:

- Learn how to install and run a test using the k6 CLI.
- Learn how to run your test using Grafana Cloud k6.
