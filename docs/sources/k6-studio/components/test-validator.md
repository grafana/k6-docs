# Test Validator

The Test Validator can help you validate that a test script is working as expected. You can use it to run one iteration of your test, and visualize the request and response of any requests on your test script, as well as [checks](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/checks/) and [logs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/k6/analyze-results/inspect-test-results/inspect-logs/). The Test Validator works with any k6 test script, not only scripts generated in k6 Studio.

The Test Validator window is composed of:

## Validate a test

There are two ways to validate a test:

- Use the **Test Generator** component:
  1.  Open a test generator
  2.  Click the menu icon on the top-right, and select **Validate script**.
- Use the **Scripts** component:
  1.  Open a script
  2.  Click **Validate script** on the top-right.

After you click **Validate script**, k6 Studio runs one iteration of the test script and shows you the results of the test as the script is executed.

## Inspect test results

During a test script run, and once it's completed, you can inspect the test results. Similar to the Test Recording component, you can click on any requests from the **Requests** list to view the request and response data, including the header, payload, and cookies.

You can also view any [logs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/k6/analyze-results/inspect-test-results/inspect-logs/) and [checks](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/checks/) generated by the test run in the **Logs** and **Checks** tabs to help you debug your test script.

## Validate external script

You can use the Test Validator to validate scripts that are created outside k6 Studio as well:

1. Open the k6-studio Scripts folder.
   - For macOS, that can be found in `~/Documents/k6-studio/Scripts`.
   - For Windows, that can be found in `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\k6-studio`.
   - If you have a script in k6 Studio already, you can right-click on it and click **Open containing folder**.
2. Copy your script to the Scripts folder.

After that, you should be able to see your test script in k6 Studio under **Scripts**. You can then open it, and click **Validate script**.
