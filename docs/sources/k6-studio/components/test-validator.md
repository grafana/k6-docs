- [**Test Validator**](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/components/test-validator/): The Test Validator can help you validate that a test script is working as expected. You can use it to run one iteration of your test, and visualize the request and response of any requests on your test script. The Test Validator works with any k6 test script, not only scripts generated via the Test Generator.

Validator
The validator can help you test a k6 script by executing a single VU and single iteration test run to make sure that your script is working as intended. You can view the selected k6 script, all the requests and responses sent with the ability to inspect them in detail, the k6 logs, and also any k6 checks that are in your script.
