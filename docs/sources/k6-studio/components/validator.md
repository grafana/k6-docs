# Validator

The Validator can help you debug test scripts. You can use it to run one iteration of your test and visualize, for example, requests, logs, and browser interactions. It supports both HTTP tests and browser tests, and can run any k6 test scripts, including scripts created outside of k6 Studio.

The content of the Validator window depends on the type of test script. The basic layout is:

{{< image-map key="k6-studio-validator" >}}

## Debug a test

To debug a script:

  1. Open a script.
  1. Click **Debug script** on the top-right.

After you click **Debug script**, k6 Studio runs one iteration of the test script and shows you the results of the test as the script is executed.

## Run a test in Grafana Cloud

After debugging a script, you can execute the same test, but using the load profile and load zones you have configured in the script, to run a performance test and see how your application behaves in a real-world scenario.

k6 Studio includes a built-in integration with Grafana Cloud, that enables you to login and run a test by clicking **Run in Grafana Cloud**. For more details, refer to [Run a test script in Grafana Cloud k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6-studio/run-test-in-grafana-cloud/).

## Inspect test results

During a debug session, and once it's completed, you can inspect the test results. The view depends on which type of test was run.

### HTTP test

{{< image-map key="k6-studio-validator-script" >}}

### Browser test

{{< image-map key="k6-studio-validator-browser-script" >}}

## Validate external script

You can use the Validator to debug scripts that are created outside k6 Studio as well:

1. From the k6 Studio homepage, click **Validate script**.
1. Click **Open script**.

Alternatively, from the Validator screen you can:

1. Click the menu options icon on the top-right.
2. Click **Open external script**.

You can then select a script located outside of k6 Studio, and then click **Debug script** to execute one iteration of the test.

If you want to view the script under the **Scripts** section of the k6 Studio application, you can:

1. Open the k6-studio Scripts folder.
   - For macOS, that can be found in `~/Documents/k6-studio/Scripts`.
   - For Windows, that can be found in `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\k6-studio/Scripts`.
   - For Linux, that can be found in `~/Documents/k6-studio/Scripts`.
   - If you have a script in k6 Studio already, you can right-click on it and click **Open containing folder**.
2. Copy your script to the Scripts folder.

After that, you should be able to see your test script in k6 Studio under **Scripts**.
