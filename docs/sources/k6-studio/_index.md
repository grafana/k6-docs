## Overview

k6 Studio is a desktop application that can help you:

- Record a user flow from browser interactions and generate a HAR file.
- Generate and customize a k6 test script from a HAR file, including the ability to use rules to quickly iterate on the script creation process.
- Test and debug k6 scripts using a visual interface. Inspect the request and response details for any request in your script.

The scripts you create in k6 Studio can be used to run performance tests in [Grafana Cloud k6](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/k6/), or as k6 scripted checks in [Synthetic Monitoring](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/synthetic-monitoring/).
