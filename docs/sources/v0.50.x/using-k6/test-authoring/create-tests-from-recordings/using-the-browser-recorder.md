# Using the browser recorder

The browser recorder lets you generate a k6 script based on a browser session.
It's available as an extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grafana-k6-browser-record/fbanjfonbcedhifbgikmjelkkckhhidl) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/grafana-k6-browser-recorder/).

## Before you start

Before you start, consider the following:

- [Be sure to record realistically](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/test-authoring/create-tests-from-recordings#be-sure-to-record-realistically)
- [A hybrid approach for load testing websites](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/test-authoring/create-tests-from-recordings#consider-hybrid-approach-for-load-testing-websites)

> Note that the browser recorders **do not require a cloud account**. For cloud users, check out the [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/k6/author-run/browser-recorder/) instructions.

## How to record

1. Install the [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grafana-k6-browser-record/fbanjfonbcedhifbgikmjelkkckhhidl) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/grafana-k6-browser-recorder/) extension.
1. Open the extension by clicking the k6 logo.
1. Choose where to save the auto-generated script.
   - To save it on your local machine, select **I don't want to save tests in the cloud**.
   - To save it on any of your Grafana Cloud k6 projects, select **Sign In**.
1. Select **Start recording** to begin recording the current browser tab.
1. When done, select **Stop recording**.
1. Save the recorded script locally or in any of your cloud projects.
1. Edit your script as necessary. Depending on the [type of load test](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/test-types/), you might need to change different aspects of the script.
   Typical changes are for [load options](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/k6-options) and to handle [correlation and dynamic data](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/examples/correlation-and-dynamic-data).
1. Run the test from the CLI or Grafana Cloud k6. For more about running k6, refer to the [Running k6 guide](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/get-started/running-k6).

## Troubleshooting. Try the HAR converter

If you experience problems recording a request, try the [HAR converter](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/test-authoring/create-tests-from-recordings/using-the-har-converter).

The Browser recorder uses the HAR converter under the hood.
Like the Browser Recorder, the HAR converter creates a k6 script from the HTTP requests included in a HAR file.

The HAR converter can also record other tabs or pop-up windows, which the Browser Recorder cannot.

If the error persists with the HAR converter, please provide detailed information about the problem [in a new issue](https://github.com/k6io/har-to-k6/issues).
