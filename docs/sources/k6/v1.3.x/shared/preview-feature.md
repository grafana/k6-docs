title: Preview feature admonition
---

{{< admonition type="note" >}}

This is a **preview** feature.
<br>
<br>
While we're committed to supporting and maintaining this feature in the future (we do not anticipate breaking changes) some functionality might be missing; it might be a bit rough around the edges; and there might be use-cases we haven't covered yet. The feature is considered ready to use, but it is in a preview state as we expect to keep iterating on it by adding new functionalities and improvements.
<br>
<br>
Users are encouraged to participate in its roadmap and implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/grafana/k6-jslib-testing). Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues) if you have any feedback or suggestions.
