# xk6-disruptor API

The xk6-disruptor API is organized around _disruptors_ that affect specific targets such as pods or services. These disruptors can inject different types of [faults](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/injecting-faults-with-xk6-disruptor/xk6-disruptor/faults) on their targets.
