# Migrate a Playwright script to k6

Playwright is an end-to-end test framework for modern web apps. It can be used for web testing across browsers, mobile web testing, API testing, and general-purpose browser automation.

You can convert your Playwright scripts to k6 browser scripts, and then use them in:

- k6 OSS or Grafana Cloud k6, to run performance tests and frontend testing at the same time, and see how your application behaves in a real-world scenario.
- Synthetic Monitoring, and make sure your application is being monitored and working correctly on a consistent schedule.

In this guide, you'll learn the key differences between Playwright and k6, and how to migrate your scripts.

## Before you begin

To run a k6 test, you'll need:

- A machine with [k6 installed](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/set-up/install-k6/).

## Example migration

Here's an example Playwright script, and common steps you can take to migrate it to a k6 script:

```js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});
```

Create a new file named `pw-migrated.js`. Copy this initial k6 script setup:

```js
import { expect } from "https://jslib.k6.io/k6-testing/0.6.0/index.js";
import { browser } from 'k6/browser';

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    ui: {
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

export default async function () {
    // paste here
}
```

k6 browser is a library that's part of k6. Any Playwright script that you migrate needs to include the `import { browser } from 'k6/browser';` line at the top.

k6 browser doesn't implement a `test` framework. Instead, the logic of test is handled inside the `export default async function ()`.

Next, copy the contents from the `test()` function from the Playwright script into the k6 `default async function ()`.

```js
import { expect } from "https://jslib.k6.io/k6-testing/0.6.0/index.js";
import { browser } from 'k6/browser';

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    ui: {
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

export default async function () {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
}
```

k6 doesn't implement `fixtures` like Playwright does. Instead, you'll need to use the `browser` class to retrieve a `page` within its own context. After that, you can use the usual `page` methods such as `goto` or `click`:

```js
import { expect } from "https://jslib.k6.io/k6-testing/0.6.0/index.js";
import { browser } from 'k6/browser';

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    ui: {
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

export default async function () {
  const page = await browser.newPage(); // <- creating a new page in its own incognito context
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
}
```

Save your script, and then run it in your terminal:

```sh
k6 run pw-migrated.js
```

You should see an output similar to the following:

```sh
> k6 run pw-migrated.js

         /\      Grafana   /‾‾/

## Migrate multiple tests

This example shows a Playwright test file containing two tests. To migrate multiple tests, use k6 scenarios to create equivalent test logic:

```js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('admin', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://quickpizza.grafana.com/admin', {
    waitUntil: 'networkidle',
  });

  await page.getByLabel('username').fill('admin');
  await page.getByLabel('password').fill('admin');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click()

  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Logout' }).waitFor()

  const label = page.locator('h2')
  const textContent = await label.textContent()
  expect(textContent).toEqual('Latest pizza recommendations');
});

test('user', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://quickpizza.grafana.com/login', {
    waitUntil: 'networkidle',
  });

  await page.getByLabel('username').fill('default');
  await page.getByLabel('password').fill('12345678');
  await page.getByText('Sign in').click();

  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Logout' }).waitFor()

  const label = page.locator('h2')
  const textContent = await label.textContent()
  expect(textContent).toEqual('Your Pizza Ratings:');
});
```

To convert this Playwright script to k6, create a new file named `pw-migrated.js`.

First, create two `scenarios` and point them to two exported functions using the `exec` field in each scenario:

```js
import { expect } from "https://jslib.k6.io/k6-testing/0.6.0/index.js";
import { browser } from 'k6/browser';

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    user: {
      exec: 'userLogin',
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
    admin: {
      exec: 'adminLogin',
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

export async function adminLogin() {
    // paste here
}

export async function userLogin() {
    // paste here
}
```

Next, copy the test code into the respective exported functions. Since k6 doesn't have fixtures, use the imported `browser` class to create a `newPage`:

```js
import { expect } from "https://jslib.k6.io/k6-testing/0.6.0/index.js";
import { browser } from 'k6/browser';

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    user: {
      exec: 'userLogin',
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
    admin: {
      exec: 'adminLogin',
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

export async function adminLogin() {
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto('https://quickpizza.grafana.com/admin', {
    waitUntil: 'networkidle',
  });

  await page.getByLabel('username').fill('admin');
  await page.getByLabel('password').fill('admin');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click()

  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Logout' }).waitFor()

  const label = page.locator('h2')
  const textContent = await label.textContent()
  expect(textContent).toEqual('Latest pizza recommendations');
}

export async function userLogin() {
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto('https://quickpizza.grafana.com/login', {
    waitUntil: 'networkidle',
  });

  await page.getByLabel('username').fill('default');
  await page.getByLabel('password').fill('12345678');
  await page.getByText('Sign in').click();

  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Logout' }).waitFor()

  const label = page.locator('h2')
  const textContent = await label.textContent()
  expect(textContent).toEqual('Your Pizza Ratings:');
}
```

Run the test script:

```sh
k6 run pw-multiple-migrated.js
```

The command runs the two scenarios concurrently and produces output similar to the following:

```sh
         /\      Grafana   /‾‾/  
    /\  /  \     |\  __   /  /   
   /  \/    \    | |/ /  /   ‾‾\ 
  /          \   |   (  |  (‾)  |
 / __________ \  |_|\_\  \_____/ 

     execution: local
        script: pw-multiple-migrated.js
        output: -

     scenarios: (100.00%) 2 scenarios, 2 max VUs, 10m30s max duration (incl. graceful stop):

## Key differences

### Test isolation patterns

In k6, [scenarios](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/scenarios/) let you configure and model diverse workloads and organize your tests. Playwright has a dedicated test framework. The difference stems from k6 being a performance testing tool.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}

There are plans to create a test framework in k6. You can refer to this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/grafana/k6-jslib-testing/issues/30) for more details, or if you'd like to contribute.

{{< /admonition >}}

### Metrics

k6 collects and reports on several built-in metrics, such as request and response times, data size, and more. It also includes support for Web Vital metrics, such as FCP, INP, and TTFB.

Refer to [Built-in metrics](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/metrics/reference/) for more details.

### k6 concepts

k6 was originally designed as a load testing tool, so there are concepts that are important to understand in order to use the tool:

- **Virtual User**: A Virtual User (VU) is an independent thread of execution that runs concurrently with other VU threads. Often, scripts are designed so that one VU activity represents that of one real user.
- **Iteration**: The number of times a single VU will run the test script.
- **Thresholds and checks**: [Thresholds](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/thresholds/) are pass/fail criteria that you can configure for your test metrics. For example, you can configure a threshold for your test to fail if more than 1% of requests return an error. [Checks](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/checks/) validate a boolean condition in your test. For example, you can check if the status code for a response is equal to 200. The main difference between the two is that thresholds that are not met make a test finish with a failed status, while checks do not. k6 also provides a k6-testing library that behaves similarly to how assertions work in Playwright. Refer to the [k6-testing](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/javascript-api/jslib/testing/) docs for more details.

### Browser context restrictions

Unlike in Playwright, k6 can only work with a single `browserContext` at a time. The following script fails when running it with k6:

<!-- md-k6:skip -->

```js
const bc1 = await browser.newContext();
// This next call will result in an error "existing browser context must be closed before creating a new one"
const bc2 = await browser.newContext();
```

To fix it, you'll have to close the existing `browserContext` first, before creating a new one.

## Hybrid tests

Hybrid tests are performance tests that run browser-level and protocol-level requests at the same time. Hybrid tests are a great alternative to running resource-intensive browser-based load testing, while still measuring how an application performs under load by making requests to the frontend and backend.

Refer to [Hybrid performance with k6 browser](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6-browser/recommended-practices/hybrid-approach-to-performance/) for more details.

## Run k6 tests in Grafana Cloud

In addition to running k6 scripts locally by installing k6 in your machine, you can also use Grafana Cloud for a seamless experience. Using Grafana Cloud means you don't have to worry about if your machine has the right resources to run a performance test, while also having pre-made Grafana dashboards to analyze test results, and being able to collaborate with other team members in debugging performance issues.

Refer to [Run a test using Grafana Cloud k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/run-k6-test-script/#run-a-test-using-grafana-cloud-k6) for more details.
