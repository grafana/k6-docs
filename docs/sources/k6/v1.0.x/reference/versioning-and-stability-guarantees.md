# Versioning and stability guarantees

As innovation sometimes requires introducing bold and extensive changes that might impact the workflow of k6â€™s consumers, our goal is to ensure stability, predictability, and ease of use for all users of k6, including those leveraging it in the cloud and other products built on top of the open source project.

In the following sections, we define workflows, guarantees, and constraints applied to k6 software, starting with version v1.0.0.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}

This document serves as an explicit allow list policy. Only APIs specifically mentioned within this document are covered by our stability guarantees. Any API not explicitly included is not covered by this policy and may be subject to breaking changes.

If you believe an API should be added to this allow list but is currently missing, please open a new issue in the [k6 repository](https://github.com/grafana/k6) to initiate discussion on its potential inclusion.

## Versioning strategy

k6 strictly follows the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme. This versioning scheme defines three kinds of software versions, categorizing their relationship to the key concept of breaking changes.

### Breaking change

As per the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) specification, we define a breaking change as a change to k6 that's not backward compatible.

Breaking changes imply that the consumer of k6 is expected to make some effort to adapt to the changes being made.

### Major version

A major version contains backward incompatible API changes.

Quoting the [SemVer 2.0.0 specification on major versions](https://semver.org/#spec-item-8) directly:

> *Major version X (X.y.z | X \> 0\) **MUST** be incremented if any backward-incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. This may also include minor and patch-level changes. Patch and minor versions **MUST** be reset to 0 when the major version is incremented.*

While it's possible that a new major version with breaking changes may remain compatible with the previous version, this should not be expected.

### Minor version

A minor version contains backward-compatible API additions/changes.

Quoting the [SemVer 2.0.0 specification on minor versions](https://semver.org/#spec-item-7) directly:

> *Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x \> 0\) **MUST** be incremented if new, backward-compatible functionality is introduced to the public API.*
> *It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated.*
> *It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code.*
> *It MAY include patch-level changes. The patch version MUST be reset to 0 when the minor version is incremented.*

### Patch version

A patch version contains bug fixes **that do not affect** the API.

Quoting the [SemVer 2.0.0 specification on patch versions](https://semver.org/#spec-item-6) directly:

> *Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x \> 0\) **MUST** be incremented if only backward compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.*

## Release strategy

A k6 release is a set of changes that updates or adds new functionalities to the product, made globally available under a unique and new identifiable version.

k6 follows and aligns with the [Grafana Labs release stages](https://grafana.com/docs/release-life-cycle). Not all changes follow every step of the release stages in a strict or sequential manner. Most of the changes directly pass from Experimental to General availability (GA).

### Frequency

The release schedule for new k6 versions is:

| Version | Cadence |
| ------- | ------- |
| Major   | Once per year |
| Minor   | Every six weeks |
| Patch   | As needed, based on priorities |

In alignment with the practice observed in the Grafana ecosystem, this allows us to maintain a regular rhythm, offering opportunities for better feature planning, communication, and visibility around releases, as well as regular cleanup of deprecated functionalities, helping reduce technical debt over time.

## What is our stable and supported API surface?

In defining the stable API surface for k6, we aim to provide clear and stable interfaces guaranteed to be maintained and supported according to our [versioning strategy](#versioning-strategy). Our stable and supported API surface includes several key components, each critical for our users and their integration workflows.

Any change to one of the APIs described below will be considered breaking. Note that the following list is intended as an allowlist, and any APIs, libraries, or components not explicitly mentioned are considered excluded. For example, the k6 REST API is an example of an accessible API not covered by the supported API surface.

### Options & command-line interface

Our stable and supported API surface includes the k6 options set, as exposed to users via the various configuration methods k6 supports: the options object, config file, environment variables, etc.

The k6 command-line interface (CLI), including commands, subcommands, and flags, is also part of the stable and supported API. These commands are essential for initiating and managing test executions locally and in the cloud.

### JavaScript interpreter

With k6 scripts written in JavaScript and the environment in which they are executed supporting a specific set of JavaScript syntax and ECMAScript features, the k6 JavaScript interpreter is considered part of the k6 stable and supported API surface.

This ensures that users can write and execute scripts with predictable behavior and compatibility over the lifespan of their major version of k6.

### Modules

The [_core_ modules](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api) exposed directly to a script by k6, for example, `k6`, `k6/http`, `k6/execution`, are another critical aspect of the k6 experience and of the interface between k6 and its users. As such, they're part of the stable and supported API surface.
It includes any class, properties, methods, function, or relative signature that is part of the module and is publicly exposed and documented.

The full list of the _core_ modules is avalilable on the [JavaScript API](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api) page.

Experimental modules, recognizable from their `k6/experimental` prefixed import path, are explicitly excluded from the stable and supported API surface.

### Extensions

Our stable and supported API surface also includes the extensions API, which empowers internal and external developers to build custom modules and outputs as part of the k6 codebase or as external extensions.

It covers any package publicly available in `go.k6.io/k6`. Consequentially, all the packages under `go.k6.io/k6/internal` package are excluded.

This includes the [go.k6.io/k6/js/modules](https://pkg.go.dev/go.k6.io/k6@v0.57.0/js/modules) Go package that internal and external developers have available to build module extensions, as well as the [go.k6.io/k6/output](https://pkg.go.dev/go.k6.io/k6@v0.57.0/output) that can be used to build custom outputs for k6.

It also includes public k6 Go packages that are exposed to developers to facilitate the development of these extensions. For example, the current [go.k6.io/k6/lib](https://pkg.go.dev/go.k6.io/k6@v0.57.0/lib) package where the [go.k6.io/k6/lib.State](https://pkg.go.dev/go.k6.io/k6@v0.57.0/lib#State) type is placed.

### Output

We guarantee the stability and support of metrics, logs, traces, and profiling outputs that we fully control in an end-to-end flow. This includes the JSON, CSV, cloud metrics, logs and traces outputs, and OpenTelemetry formats while excluding outputs dependent on third-party platforms and protocols.

### Metrics

We guarantee the stability of metric names, types, and units. Any changes to these are considered breaking and will be handled according to our [versioning strategy](#versioning-strategy). Doing so ensures that any product or artifact built on top of k6, such as dashboards, can maintain a reliable and consistent experience.

## Deprecation, breaking changes, and migration policy

### Breaking changes

In a constantly evolving product, [breaking changes](#breaking-change) are sometimes unavoidable. They require that k6 users actively react to them because the state after the changes is not backward compatible with the previous state.

Because we follow the [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) versioning scheme, we work under the assumption breaking changes will always lead to a new major version. When the k6 team decides to introduce a breaking change, it will automatically define the need for a new major version.

When k6 releases a new major version, we are expected to be explicit, clearly communicate the breaking changes, and provide instructions for migrating users.

There are two types of breaking changes:

1. Removal
2. Update

When a breaking change is added, the k6 team will follow the following steps:

#### Remove an API or a feature

1. Deprecate a current API or a feature by following the dedicated policy.
1. If necessary, add an alternative solution. Ideally, this would be an experimental version within a minor release within the current maintained state. Alternatively, it might be available in a Preview release.
1. Provide documentation for the migration path.
1. Proceed with removing the API and releasing a new major version.

#### Update an API or a feature

1. Apply the changes, then publish them in the next major version. If the change is significant, it might be convenient to make it available in a Preview release that can support the migration path until a version is globally available.
1. Provide documentation for the migration path.

### Deprecation

When the k6 team intends to remove an API or a feature, it will be marked as *deprecated*. This occurs when an API becomes obsolete, superseded by another API, or otherwise discontinued for business or technological reasons.
Deprecated APIs remain available during their deprecation phase, and we guarantee they will be maintained for the entire lifecycle of the current major version.

A deprecation will be announced through several layers of communication before it will be officially applied:

1. Release notes.
2. Official documentation.
3. When the user directly interacts with the feature.
4. An alternative already available is recommended, but it shouldnâ€™t be considered mandatory.

### Migration

When a breaking change is introduced, or an API is superseded, then documentation for a migration guide will be provided to users to help them understand how to move from version to version.
The migration path will be available in the official documentation, and it will be mentioned in all other communication channels.

## Support and development policies

We define k6 support and development policies according to four states where a k6 version can be implemented. At any given time, we have:

* **The under-development** version is the next upcoming version of k6. Note that this version might either start a new major version, for example, developing v3.0.0 while the latest release is v2.8.2, or it might be a new minor or patch iteration over the latest release.
* **The actively maintained** version is the latest released major version of k6.
* **The supported** version is the latest released version of k6 within the previous major version.
* **The deprecated** versions are the set of previously released k6 versions.

As such, during its development and support workflow, the k6 open source project actively develops the next version of k6, maintains the latest major release, supports the previous major version, and doesn't provide any support for releases older than the supported one.

Any past version of k6 thatâ€™s neither being developed, maintained, or supported is considered **deprecated** and will not receive further updates or development, including bug fixes or security updates. Users are free to use them at their own risk.

### Guidelines

1. _Features are not backported_ from one major version to any previous one.
2. Only changes on the latest release of each support category are provided: _at any point in time, there are single officially under-development and actively maintained versions_. We do not support multiple versions of each support path. For example, suppose a bug is found in v1.1.0, and the latest v1.Y.Z published release is v1.3.2. In that case, if and only if the latest release is affected, and the bug or security issue is deemed important enough, only then does the development team define as a priority to publish a fix that will be released in v1.3.3. Users cannot expect a v1.1.1 fix release.
3. Other Grafana products, services, and teams building upon k6 are expected to develop their versioning integration built on our support policies.

#### Bugs & Security issues

Bugs and security issues come in all shapes and sizes and vary widely in impact. Some are critical, compromising user safety or impacting software functionality, while others are minor annoyances that do not require immediate action.

The k6 open-source core team, with input from affected stakeholders, is responsible for assessing the severity of these issues.

We classify bug severity based on their impact on users or product functionality. High-severity bugs prevent a subset of users from using the software properly or at all. Depending on the severity, the team will either release an immediate patch or, for less critical bugs, delay the fix to the next scheduled release.

Security issues are classified using the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score when available. In its absence, we evaluate the threat in collaboration with the security team and affected teams. This assessment considers the potential threat to customers, users, system health, and data integrity. Like bug fixes, the response will be either an immediate patch release for high-severity issues or a delayed fix for lower-severity issues.
### Guarantees

#### Under development

At any point in the k6 development lifecycle, the next version of k6 is being developed.

The next version of k6 can be a [major](#major-version), [minor](#minor-version), or [patch](#patch-version) one. This developed version is then released according to our [versioning strategy and scheme](#versioning-strategy) and becomes the latest maintained version of k6.

#### Actively maintained

The latest version, released under the currently active [major version](#major-version), is maintained.

In the event of a bug, security issue, or necessary dependency update:
* **If the under-development version is expected to remain within the same [major version](#major-version) scope**, the fix or update is expected to land in said version, which will become, in turn, the next maintained version once released.
* **If the under-development version is expected to switch to a new [major version](#major-version) scope**, the fix or update will be included in the currently maintained major version scope and released as the latest maintained version (patch).

#### Supported k6 version

At any point, the prior major version will be in **support** mode. The supported version of k6 will receive no further updates or features backport but will keep receiving major and security bug fixes. Its [minor version](#minor-version) is not expected to change anymore, and it should only see its [patch version](#patch-version) grow.

#### Deprecated k6 versions

A major version of k6, which is two major versions away from the past (for example, v1.0.0, when the latest version is v3.0.0), is considered **deprecated** and wonâ€™t receive any form of support anymore.
The same applies to a minor version.

### Real-world scenarios

#### A major (bug or security) issue is found with the latest release of k6

The latest release of k6 is **actively maintained**. Within this versionâ€™s major scope is a single maintained version, the latest one.

Thus, when a security issue or bug affects the actively maintained version, the k6 team puts together a fix and publishes a new [patch version](#patch-version) of the currently maintained version. Although the under-development version should integrate those changes, we still reserve the right to release a new intermediary release.

If the issue or bug also affects the supported version of k6, we apply the fix to it and publish a [patch version](#patch-version) of the currently supported version of k6.

If the issue also affects a deprecated version of k6, we take no action and invite users to upgrade to at least the latest *supported version* of k6.

#### An issue is found in the supported version of k6

When a security issue or bug is found in the currently **supported** version of k6, the k6 team creates a fix in the support versionâ€™s branch. It publishes a new [patch version](#patch-version) of the supported version, which becomes the new supported version of k6.

If the issue also affects the k6 version, which is currently the [major version](#major-version), a separate fix should be released as a [patch version](#patch-version) within the maintained versionâ€™s major scope.

If the issue also affects deprecated versions of k6, we take no action and invite users to upgrade to at least the latest *supported version* of k6.

#### An issue is found in a deprecated version of k6

If an issue (security-related or a bug) is found in a **deprecated** version, we do not take action and recommend that users upgrade to a supported version of k6.

## Experimental

Within k6, some APIs, features, and modules are explicitly marked as experimental.

Those APIs, features, and modules are either made of changes or new capabilities, which we believe are valuable to our users and the development of k6. Still, they are _not yet stable_.

An experimental API, feature, or module _can undergo a breaking change and be completely removed without prior notice_. Our support policy does not cover experimental APIs, features, and modules. As such, we advise products, projects, and teams not to rely on them explicitly for mission-critical operations and to build upon them if possible.

They should be marked and communicated internally and, most importantly, externally. When a user interacts with an experimental feature or module, it _must_ be explicitly communicated to them. How to do it depends on the layer where the change is introduced and can vary case by case.

For example, a JavaScript module should be recognizable as an experimental module by its import path, which includes the `k6/experimental/` prefix. Advertising the experimental state via the official documentation is also highly encouraged. However, using it as a unique level shouldnâ€™t be considered sufficient communication.
The development team is responsible for deciding what the reasonable level is based on the specific case.

Experimental APIs, features, and modules may eventually become stable. When that happens, it will lead to a new minor version of k6 in most cases. The experimental module import path becomes deprecated and will be removed in a couple of minor releases with a future notice.

## Versioning policy

We reserve ourselves the right to modify the versioning strategy and policies as part of a major release, under the constraints that:

* We maintain a changelog of the modifications we do in the document itself.
* The document remains public and accessible to users.
* We communicate changes in the context of new releases.

For example, letâ€™s assume we decide to introduce a new supported API surface, like the REST API v2. We would amend this document accordingly and publish and enforce the change to the affected workflows as part of the next major release.
