# Browser options

To enable browser testing, add the `browser` configuration within the `options` property of the [Scenario options](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/scenarios/#options).

```javascript
export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    foo: {
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Script options

| Option                    | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type<sup>(required)</sup> | Name of the browser running the test. Options include `'chromium'`. |

## Environment variable options

You can customize the behavior of the browser module by passing environment variables.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}

Customizing browser options via environment variables is unsupported when [running browser tests in Grafana Cloud k6](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/k6/get-started/run-your-first-browser-tests/).

### Default arguments

List of default arguments included when launching the browser process. You can pass one or more of the arguments to the `K6_BROWSER_IGNORE_DEFAULT_ARGS` environment variable when starting a test for the ones you want to ignore.

The starting '--' have been omitted from the argument names in these lists.
