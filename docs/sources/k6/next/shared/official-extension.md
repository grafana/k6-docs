{{< admonition type="note">}}

This module is implemented as an official extension and is not part of k6 by default. However, k6's [automatic extension resolution](/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/extensions/run) makes it available seamlessly when you import it in your script. Refer to the [extensions documentation](/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/extensions/explore) for available extensions and details.
