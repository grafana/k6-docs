## Best practices

1. **Complement, don't replace labels**: Placeholder text should supplement, not replace proper form labels for accessibility.
1. **Use descriptive placeholders**: Ensure placeholder text clearly indicates the expected input format or content.
1. **Consider internationalization**: When testing multi-language applications, be aware that placeholder text may change.
1. **Accessibility considerations**: Remember that placeholder text alone may not be sufficient for users with disabilities.
