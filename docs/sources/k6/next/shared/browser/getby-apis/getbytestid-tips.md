## Best practices

1. **Stable identifiers**: Use meaningful, stable test IDs that won't change with refactoring or content updates.
1. **Hierarchical naming**: Use consistent naming conventions like `user-profile-edit-btn`.
1. **Avoid duplicates**: Ensure test IDs are unique within the page to prevent ambiguity.
1. **Strategic placement**: Add test IDs to key interactive elements and components that are frequently tested.
1. **Team coordination**: Establish test ID conventions with your development team to ensure consistency.
