## Best practices

1. **Meaningful titles**: Ensure title attributes provide clear, helpful information about the element's purpose or content.
1. **Accessibility compliance**: Use titles to enhance accessibility, especially for elements that might not have clear visual labels.
1. **Avoid redundancy**: Don't duplicate visible text in the title attribute unless providing additional context.
1. **Dynamic content**: When testing applications with changing title content, use flexible matching patterns or regular expressions.
1. **Tooltip testing**: Remember that title attributes often create tooltips on hover, which can be useful for UI testing.
1. **Internationalization**: Consider that title text may change in different language versions of your application.
