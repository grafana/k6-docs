/**
 * **ICMP protocol support for k6**
 *
 * **xk6-icmp** is a k6 extension that adds support for sending ICMP echo requests ({@link ping}) to measure network latency and availability.
 * This allows you to measure network latency and reachability of
 * hosts directly within your load testing and synthetic monitoring scenarios.
 *
 * The main use case for this extension is integration with Grafana's Synthetic Monitoring product
 * to make a quick reachability check after a scripted check fails.
 * It can also be used directly in k6 scripts, for example as a pre-check to verify network connectivity
 * before running your main test.
 *
 * @module icmp
 *
 * @example Basic Usage
 *
 * Here is a basic example showing how to use the {@link ping} function:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import { ping } from "k6/x/icmp"
 *
 * export default function () {
 *   const host = "8.8.8.8"
 *
 *   console.log(`Pinging ${host}:`);
 *
 *   if (ping(host)) {
 *     console.log(`Host ${host} is reachable`);
 *   } else {
 *     console.error(`Host ${host} is unreachable`);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Advanced Usage
 *
 * A more advanced example below demonstrates how to use the {@link PingCallback} to access detailed
 * ping results for each request.
 *
 * ```javascript
 *
 * import { ping } from "k6/x/icmp"
 *
 * export default async function () {
 *   const host = "8.8.8.8"
 *
 *   console.log(`Pinging ${host} with callback:`);
 *
 *   const opts = {
 *     timeout: 3000,
 *     count: 5
 *   };
 *
 *   const result = await pingAsync(host, opts, (err, { target, sent_at, received_at, seq, ttl, size }) => {
 *     if (err) {
 *       console.error(`${target}: ${err}`);
 *
 *       return
 *     }
 *
 *     const rtt = received_at - sent_at;
 *
 *     console.log(`${size} bytes from ${target}: icmp_seq=${seq} ttl=${ttl} time=${rtt} ms`);
 *   });
 *
 *   if (result) {
 *     console.log(`Host ${host} is reachable`);
 *   } else {
 *     console.error(`Host ${host} is unreachable`);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
