# Version 0.56.0 release notes

k6 `v0.56.0` is here ðŸŽ‰! This release includes:

- We've merged xk6-browser into k6.
- Many small improvements, bug fixes and internal refactors.

## Breaking changes

- [browser#1541](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1541) Removes `accessibility-events` from a test, which is no longer a valid permission that can be granted by the latest version of Chromium/Chrome.
- [#4093](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4093) Unexports `lib/consts.FullVersion` from the k6's Golang API.

## New features

### Merge browser code in k6 codebase [#4056](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4056)

While the browser module has been stabilized, the codebase was not moved inside of k6.

As part of the stabilization this is now also merged in the k6 codebase. In the following months we would move issues from the [xk6-browser](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser) repo and then archive it.
