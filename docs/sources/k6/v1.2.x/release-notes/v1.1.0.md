# Version 1.1.0 release notes

<!-- md-k6:skipall -->

k6 `v1.1.0` is here ðŸŽ‰! This release includes:

- New `count`, `nth`, `first`, and `last` methods for the browser module's Locator API [#4797](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4797), [#4825](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4825)
- The `k6/experimental/webcrypto` module has been removed as its functionality is available globally.
- Group results in the `full` end-of-test summary are now sorted as in code and properly indented.

## Breaking changes

*As per our [stability guarantees](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/reference/versioning-and-stability-guarantees/),
breaking changes across minor releases are allowed only for experimental features.*

### Breaking changes for experimental modules

#### Remove experimental `k6/experimental/webcrypto` module [#4851](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4851)

The [WebCrypto API](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/crypto/) has been available globally since `v1.0.0-rc1` (or `v0.58.0`), and now the experimental import (`k6/experimental/webcrypto`) is no longer available.

The required change for users is to remove the `import`; the rest of the code should work.

## New features

### New `count` method for the browser module's Locator API [#4797](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4797)

The new `locator.Count` method returns the number of elements matching the `locator`. Unlike other Locator API methods, `locator.Count` returns the result immediately and doesn't wait for the elements to be visible.

```javascript
import { expect } from "https://jslib.k6.io/k6-testing/0.4.0/index.js";
import { browser } from 'k6/browser'

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    ui: {
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
}

export default async function () {
  const page = await browser.newPage()
  await page.goto('https://quickpizza.grafana.com/login')

  expect(await page.locator('input').count()).toEqual(3);

  await page.close();
}
```

### New `nth`, `first` and `last` methods for the browser module's Locator API [#4825](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4825)

The new Locator API methods, `nth`, `first`, and `last`, can select a single element from multiple elements matched by a `locator`. For example, selecting a single item from a catalogue of items on an e-commerce website. Because items in this catalogue generally change often and selecting an exact element may fail in future test runs, the new methods help to prevent flaky tests, leading to more reliable tests.

```javascript
import { expect } from "https://jslib.k6.io/k6-testing/0.4.0/index.js";
import { browser } from 'k6/browser'

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    ui: {
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
}

export default async function () {
  const page = await browser.newPage()
  await page.goto('https://quickpizza.grafana.com')

  await expect(await page.locator('p').first()).toContainText('QuickPizza');
  await expect(await page.locator('p').nth(4)).toContainText('QuickPizza Labs.');
  await expect(await page.locator('p').last()).toContainText('Contribute to QuickPizza');

  await page.close();
}
```
