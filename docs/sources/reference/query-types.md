# Query types

The k6 data source has the following query types, each with its own unique panel.

**Metrics**

: k6 Metrics to measure SUT performance, measured as rates, counters, gauges, or trends.

: The panel is a line chart for the value of the metric over the test run.

**URLs**

: Metrics for a specific URL that was requested in the test script

**Thresholds**

: Comparison of defined threshold value against the metric values emitted during the test run

caption="The panel is a time series with lines. One line indicates the threshold value, and another indicates the values for the metric over the test run. If the threshold is never crossed, the value for the metric always stays above or below the threshold line."
