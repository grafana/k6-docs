# Selection

Represents a set of nodes in a DOM tree.

Selections have a jQuery-compatible API, but with two caveats:

- CSS and screen layout are not processed, thus calls like css() and offset() are unavailable.
- DOM trees are read-only, you can't set attributes or otherwise modify nodes.

(Note that the read-only nature of the DOM trees is purely to avoid a maintenance burden on code with seemingly no practical use - if a compelling use case is presented, modification can easily be implemented.)
