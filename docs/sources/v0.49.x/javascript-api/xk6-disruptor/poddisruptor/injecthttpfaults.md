# injectHTTPFaults()

injectHTTPFaults injects HTTP faults in the requests served by a target Pod.

| Parameter          | Type   | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fault              | object | description of the [http faults](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/faults/http) to be injected |
| duration           | string | duration of the disruption                                                                                                         |
| options (optional) | object | [options](#options) that control the injection of the fault                                                                        |

## options

The injection of the fault is controlled by the following options:

| Option    | Type   | Description                                                                         |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| proxyPort | number | port the agent will use to listen for requests in the target pods ( default `8000`) |

{{% admonition type="note" %}}

When injecting faults you may find the following error message during the test execution:

WARN\[0035\] Request Failed error="read tcp 172.18.0.1:43564->172.18.255.200:80: read: connection reset by peer"

This is normal and means that one request was "in transit" at the time the faults were injected, causing the request to fail from a network connection reset.

```javascript
const fault = {
  averageDelay: '50ms',
  errorCode: 500,
  errorRate: 0.1,
};
disruptor.injectHTTPFaults(fault, '30s');
```
