# Ramping VUs

With the `ramping-vus` executor, a variable number of VUs executes as many iterations as possible for a specified amount of time.

For a shortcut to this executor, use the [stages](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/k6-options#stages) option.

## Options

Besides the [common configuration options](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/scenarios#options),
this executor has the following options:

| Option                      | Type    | Description                                                                                    | Default |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| stages<sup>(required)</sup> | array   | Array of objects that specify the target number of VUs to ramp up or down to.                  | `[]`    |
| startVUs                    | integer | Number of VUs to run at test start.                                                            | `1`     |
| gracefulRampDown            | string  | Time to wait for an already started iteration to finish before stopping it during a ramp down. | `"30s"` |

## When to use

This executor is a good fit if you need VUs to ramp up or down during specific periods
of time.

## Example

This example schedules a two-stage test, ramping up from 0 to 10 VUs over 20 seconds, then down
to 0 VUs over 10 seconds.

{{< code >}}

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  discardResponseBodies: true,
  scenarios: {
    contacts: {
      executor: 'ramping-vus',
      startVUs: 0,
      stages: [
        { duration: '20s', target: 10 },
        { duration: '10s', target: 0 },
      ],
      gracefulRampDown: '0s',
    },
  },
};

export default function () {
  http.get('https://test.k6.io/contacts.php');
  // Injecting sleep
  // Sleep time is 500ms. Total iteration time is sleep + time to finish request.
  sleep(0.5);
}
```

{{% admonition type="note" %}}

With [`gracefulRampDown`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/scenarios/concepts/graceful-stop#the-gracefulrampdown) set to 0 seconds, some iterations might be
interrupted during the ramp down stage.

## Observations

The following graph depicts the performance of the [example](#example) script:

![Ramping VUs](/media/docs/k6-oss/ramping-vus.png)

Based upon our test scenario inputs and results:

- The configuration defines 2 stages for a total test duration of 30 seconds;
- Stage 1 ramps _up_ VUs linearly from the `startVUs` of 0 to the target of 10 over a 20 second duration;
- From the 10 VUs at the end of stage 1, stage 2 then ramps _down_ VUs linearly to the target of 0 over a 10 second duration;
- Each _iteration_ of the `default` function is expected to be roughly 515ms, or ~2/s;
- As the number of VUs changes, the iteration rate directly correlates; each addition of a VU increases the rate by about 2 iters/s, whereas each subtraction of a VU reduces by about 2 iters/s;
- The example performed ~300 iterations over the course of the test.

## Get the stage index

To get the current running stage index, use the `getCurrentStageIndex` helper function from the [k6-jslib-utils](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/javascript-api/jslib/utils) library. It returns a zero-based number equal to the position in the shortcut `stages` array or in the executor's `stages` array.

```javascript
import { getCurrentStageIndex } from 'https://jslib.k6.io/k6-utils/1.3.0/index.js';

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { target: 10, duration: '30s' },
    { target: 50, duration: '1m' },
    { target: 10, duration: '30s' },
  ],
};

export default function () {
  if (getCurrentStageIndex() === 1) {
    console.log('Running the second stage where the expected target is 50');
  }
}
```

Using this feature, it is possible to automatically tag using the current running stage. Check the [Tagging stages](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/tags-and-groups#tagging-stages) section for more details.
