title: StatsD module admonition

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}

The built-in StatsD output has been deprecated on k6 v0.47.0 and [scheduled to be removed in v0.55.0](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3849). You can continue to use this feature by using the [xk6-output-statsd extension](https://github.com/LeonAdato/xk6-output-statsd), or using the [OpenTelemetry output](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/results-output/real-time/opentelemetry/) depending on your use case.

For more information on the reason behind this change, you can follow [this issue](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2982) in the k6 repository.
