# Send notifications

It would be tedious to monitor every test in your ongoing test operations.
Instead, you can configure sending notifications whenever a significant test event happens.
For example, you could send a notification whenever a test unexpectedly aborts or fails a check or threshold.

k6 supports the following ways to send notifications:
- To a third-party platform, like workspaces for [Slack](#add-a-slack-notification) and [Microsoft teams](#add-a-microsoft-teams-notification)
- Through a custom [webhooks](#add-a-custom-webhook)
- Through [email](#add-a-custom-email-notification)

When you [schedule a test]({{< relref "schedule-a-test" >}}) or add it to your continuous integration pipeline, 
you'll likely want to configure a notification for failed events, thus automating test execution and observation.

> Note: Only organization owners and admins can set up notifications.

## Add a Slack notification

To send notifications to Slack, follow these steps.

1. From Slack, add a **Custom Integration** and select **Incoming WebHook** app.
1. Select or create a channel and copy Slack's generated WebHook URL.

In Grafana Cloud k6:

1. In the sidebar menu, go to **Settings > Notifications**

      Currently, it redirects you to [k6 Cloud (app.k6.io)](https://app.k6.io/) to configure notifications.
2. Paste the Slack WebHook URL into the **Webhook URL** input field.
3. From the **Notification event** dropdown, choose the events that will trigger notifications or select all.
   Refer to the [supported notification events](#supported-notification-events).
4. Optionally, give your notification a name (in case you want more than one Slack integration).
5. **Save**.

  If you now go back to **Configure** the notification you just created, you'll see a
   **Send test event** button. Use that to send a dummy message and to make sure it works.

> With the _toggle advanced mode_ button, you can view and customize exactly what k6 sends to Slack. Read more about it in the [Custom webhook](#add-a-custom-webhook) section below.


## Add a Microsoft Teams notification

First, figure out the webhook URL for your Microsoft Team setup.
Then go the Grafana Cloud k6 and follow these steps.

1. In the sidebar menu, go to **Settings > Notifications**

      Currently, it redirects you to [k6 Cloud (app.k6.io)](https://app.k6.io/) to configure notifications.

2. From there, select **Microsoft Teams**.
3. Paste the Teams URL into the **Webhook URL** input field.
4. From the **Notification event** dropdown, pick the events you want to be notified by, or all of them.
   Refer to the [supported notification events](#supported-notification-events).
5. Optionally, give your notification a name (in case you want more than one Teams integration).
6. **Save**.

  If you now go back to **Configure** the notification you just created, you'll see a
  **Send test event** button. Use that to send a dummy message and make sure it works.

> To view and customize exactly what k6 sends to Microsoft Teams,
> use the **Advanced mode** toggle.
> Read more about it in the [Custom webhook](#add-a-custom-webhook) section below.


## Add a Custom Webhook

While k6 offers defaults for Slack and Microsoft Teams, you can send to any
third-party service with a webhook integration.
You can customize the JSON payload directly in the k6 app.

First, get the webhook URL of your service of choice.
If experimenting, you might first try a free online service that provides temporary
URLs for webhook debugging, like [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/).

1. In the sidebar menu, go to **Settings > Notifications**

      Currently, it redirects you to [k6 Cloud (app.k6.io)](https://app.k6.io/) to configure notifications.
1. From there, select **Custom Webhook**.
1. Add your URL in the **Webhook URL** input field.
1. From the **Notification event** dropdown, pick the events you want to be notified by, or all of them.
   Refer to the [supported notification events](#supported-notification-events).
   You can find descriptions of the available events [below](#supported-notification-events).
1. Optionally, give your notification a name to separate different hooks.
1. Optionally, select a `Template` to start from. The _Generic Template_ showcases all the possible
   values k6 can send. The _Slack/Microsoft Teams_ templates are the same ones you can customize when you send webhooks to those services.
1. Modify the JSON payload as needed. Refer to [Template context variables](#template-context-variables) as needed.
1.  **Save** and fix any eventual errors reported.

  After you save, select the notification you just created.
  Then test your webhook with the **Send test event**.
  k6 will fill all the context fields in your template with mock values.

Fix any errors reported by sending the test event. Double-check that each field's value is what you expect.

## Add a Custom Email notification

Instead of using webhooks,  you can have k6.io send you an email.
First, decide which email addresses will receive the notification.
Then, follow these steps.

1. In the sidebar menu, go to **Settings > Notifications**

      Currently, it redirects you to [k6 Cloud (app.k6.io)](https://app.k6.io/) to configure notifications.
2. From there, select **Email**.
3. In the **Recipients** field, select your organization's member emails from the dropdown, or enter the email addresses that should receive the
   notification. Use commas or spaces to separate emails.
4. Enter an email Subject.
   This helps filter and organize notifications in your email program.
5. From the **Notification event** dropdown, choose the events you want to be notified about, or select all.
   Refer to [Supported notification events](#supported-notification-events).
6. Optionally, give your notification a name to separate different notifications.
7. Optionally, select a `Template` to start from. The default _Email notification_ is a simple
   HTML-enhanced email template with human-readable test results. You can edit this to your liking.
8. **Save** and fix any reported errors.

   After you save, open the webhook and test it with the **Send test event** button. This sends a dummy
   message to your email address/addresses. k6 will fill the context fields in your template with mock values.

Fix any errors reported by sending the test event. Double-check that value for each field is what you expect.

## Supported Notification events

Broadly, two types of events trigger notifications:
- When a test run _starts_
- When a test run _ends_

Within these categories, you can granularly configure which events trigger notifications.

### Events when a test starts

| Event name             | Identifier               | Description                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Test started           | `test.started.manual`    | Only tests started manually    |
| Scheduled test started | `test.started.scheduled` | Only tests that were scheduled |

### Events when a test ends

| Event name                  | Identifier                           | Description                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test finished               | `test.finished.finished`             | All tests that ends with a `Finished` run status                              |
| Test finished successfully  | `test.finished.success`              | Only tests that _pass_ (all [thresholds](/using-k6/thresholds) must pass too) |
| Test failed                 | `test.finished.failed`               | Only tests that _fail_ their thresholds                                       |
| Test timed out              | `test.finished.timed_out`            | Only tests that _timed out_ in some way due to an upstream issue              |
| Test aborted (by user)      | `test.finished.aborted_user`         | Only tests that were _aborted_ manually by a user                             |
| Test aborted (by system)    | `test.finished.aborted_system`       | Only tests that were _aborted_ due to some upstream system problem            |
| Test aborted (script error) | `test.finished.aborted_script_error` | Only tests that were _aborted_ due to a test-script error                     |
| Test aborted (by threshold) | `test.finished.aborted_threshold`    | Only tests that were _aborted_ by crossing a test threshold                   |
| Test aborted (by limit)     | `test.finished.aborted_limit`        | Only tests that were _aborted_ due to hitting an execution or network limit   |

You can safely pick multiple options and get at most get two notifications per
test-run, one when it starts and one when it ends.
k6 passes the event identifier along to specify which condition triggered the notification.

## Templating syntax

The notification templates use the
[Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) templating language.
Jinja uses `{{ }}` to mark places in the template that will be replaced by
actual values when the notification is created.

For example, let's say we want to include the test name and identifier in our context.

From the `Template Context` list, note that these
variables are accessed as `test.name` and `test.id`. Here's what we need to add
to the template:

```json
{
  ...
    "name": "{{ test.name }}",
    "test_run_id": {{ test.id }},
  ...
}
```

Jinja also supports simple if/else conditionals. Write conditionals in the form:

```json
{% if condition %}if_true_result{% else %}if_untrue_result{% endif %}
```

Here is an example (from the generic template) of setting a color based on the result of the test-run:

```json
{
    ...
    "color": "{% if test.result == 1 %}red{% else %}green{% endif %}",
    ...
}
```

Jinja also allows for for-loops.

```json
{% for value in iterable}
    ...
{% endfor %}
```

This example loops over the list of `errors` (if any):

```json
"errors": [
      {% for error in errors %}
        {
          "code": {{error.code}},
          "error_created": "{{error.created}}",
          "error_detail": "{{error.detail}}"
        }{{"," if not loop.last}}
      {% endfor %}
  ]
```

The `loop.last` is a special Jinja feature.
Here it used in place of a comma after the last item (a comma at the end would not be valid JSON).

> Remember that after the Jinja-parsing/replacing, the result _must be a valid JSON structure_.
> So in the examples above, note how we can leave the `test.id` as-is (since
> it's an int), but because the `test.name` is a string, it must be enclosed
> in quotes `" ... "`. In the same way, the for-loop output must be created inside `[ ... ]` to
> have the result be a proper JSON array.


## Template Context variables

You can use these variables in your notification templates.

To access them as expressions, use the default `{{ }}` delimiters.
Note the type of each value and especially remember to put double quotes around strings, so the result after template-replacement is still valid JSON.

### test

## Notification message format

When an event is triggered, the cloud service sends a POST request to the configured URL.

Headers sent with all requests:

| Header            | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `X-k6cloud-ID`    | Unique ID for this request           |
| `X-k6cloud-Event` | Name of the event, like "test.ended" |
| `User-Agent`      | Always "K6CloudWebHook"              |

Header Example:


```json
X-k6cloud-ID: 19c5d426-3b4d-43c3-8277-37ad7d457430
X-k6cloud-Event: test.started
User-Agent: K6CloudWebHook
```

The body of the request is a JSON structure created by populating the chosen
notification template with values relevant to the event.
