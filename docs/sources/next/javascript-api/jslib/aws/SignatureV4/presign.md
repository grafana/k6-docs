# presign

`SignatureV4.presign()` pre-signs a URL with the AWS Signature V4 algorithm. Given an HTTP request description, it returns a new HTTP request with the AWS signature v4 authorization added. It returns an Object holding a `url` containing the authorization information encoded in its query string, ready to use in the context of a k6 HTTP call.

### Parameters

The first parameter of the `presign` method consists of an Object with the following properties.

| Property | Type                     | Description                         |
| :------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| method   | string                   | The HTTP method of the request      |
| protocol | `http` or `https` string | The network protocol of the request |
| hostname | string                   | The hostname the request is sent to |
| path     | string                   | The path of the request             |
| headers  | Object                   | The headers of the HTTP request     |

You can provide further options and override SignatureV4 options in the context of this specific request.
To do this, pass a second parameter to the `presign` method, which is an Object with the following parameters.

| Property          | Type          | Description                                                                |
| :---------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| expiresIn         | number        | The number of seconds before the pre-signed URL expires                    |
| signingDate       | Date          | overrides the Date used in the signing operation                           |
| signingService    | string        | overrides the signer's AWS service in the context of the `sign` operation. |
| signingRegion     | string        | overrides the signer's AWS region in the context of the `sign` operation   |
| unsignableHeaders | `Set<string>` | excludes headers from the signing process                                  |
| signableHeaders   | `Set<string>` | mark headers as signed                                                     |

### Returns

The `presign` operation returns an Object with the following properties.

| Property | Type   | Description                                                               |
| :------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| headers  | Object | The pre-signed request headers to use in the context of a k6 HTTP request |
| url      | string | The pre-signed url to use in the context of a k6 HTTP request             |
