k6 Studio is a desktop application that can help you:

- Record a user flow from browser interactions and generate a HAR file.
- Generate and customize a k6 test script from a HAR file, including the ability to use rules to quickly iterate on the script creation process.
- Test and debug k6 scripts using a visual interface. Inspect the request and response details for any request in your script.
