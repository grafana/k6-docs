title: StatsD module admonition

{{% admonition type="warning" %}}

The built-in StatsD output has been deprecated on k6 v0.47.0 and [scheduled to remove in v0.55.0](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3849). You can continue to use this feature by using the [xk6-output-statsd extension](https://github.com/LeonAdato/xk6-output-statsd), and this guide has been updated to include instructions for how to use it.

For more information on the reason behind this change, you can follow [this issue](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2982) in the k6 repository.
