# Crawl a web page

Refer to this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60927653/downloading-whole-websites-with-k6/) for details on how you can use k6 to crawl a web page.

You can also use the [Grafana k6 Browser Recorder](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/grafana-k6-browser-record/fbanjfonbcedhifbgikmjelkkckhhidl), or the [k6 DevTools Recorder](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/k6-devtools-recorder/fkajbajcclbdgaoanencnhpfnigfipgc) to record a browser session and export it as a k6 test script.
