# Inject HTTP faults into Pod

This example shows how [PodDisruptor](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/injecting-faults-with-xk6-disruptor/xk6-disruptor/poddisruptor) can be used for testing the effect of faults injected in the HTTP requests served by a pod.

You will find the complete [source code](#source-code) at the end of this document. Next sections examine the code in detail.

The example uses [httpbin](https://httpbin.org), a simple request/response application that offers endpoints for testing different HTTP requests.

The test requires `httpbin` to be deployed in a cluster in the namespace `httpbin` and exposed with an external IP. the IP address is expected in the environment variable `SVC_IP`.

You will find the Kubernetes manifests and the instructions of how to deploy it to a cluster in the [test setup](#test-setup) section at the end of this document. You can learn more about how to get the external IP address in the [expose your application](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/injecting-faults-with-xk6-disruptor/expose--your-application) section.

## Initialization

The initialization code imports the external dependencies required by the test. The `PodDisruptor` class imported from the `xk6-disruptor` extension provides functions for injecting faults in pods. The [k6/http](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/javascript-api/k6-http) module provides functions for executing HTTP requests.

```javascript
import { PodDisruptor } from 'k6/x/disruptor';
import http from 'k6/http';
```

## Test Load

The test load is generated by the `default` function, which executes a request to the `httpbin` pod using the IP obtained from the environment variable `SVC_IP`. The test makes requests to the endpoint `delay/0.1` which will return after `0.1` seconds (`100ms`).

```javascript
export default function (data) {
  http.get(`http://${data.SVC_IP}/delay/0.1`);
}
```

{{% admonition type="note" %}}

The test uses the `delay` endpoint which return after the requested delay. It requests a `0.1s` (`100ms`) delay to ensure the baseline scenario (see scenarios below) has meaningful statistics for the request duration. If we were simply calling a locally deployed http server (for example `nginx`), the response time would exhibit a large variation between a few microseconds to a few milliseconds. Having `100ms` as baseline response time has proved to offer more consistent results.

## Fault injection

The `disrupt` function creates a `PodDisruptor` using a selector that matches pods in the namespace `httpbin` with the label `app: httpbin`.

The http faults are injected by calling the [PodDisruptor.injectHTTPFaults](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/injecting-faults-with-xk6-disruptor/xk6-disruptor/poddisruptor/injecthttpfaults) method using a fault definition that introduces a delay of `50ms` on each request and an error code `500` in `10%` of the requests.

```javascript
export function disrupt(data) {
  if (__ENV.SKIP_FAULTS == '1') {
    return;
  }
  const selector = {
    namespace: namespace,
    select: {
      labels: {
        app: 'httpbin',
      },
    },
  };
  const podDisruptor = new PodDisruptor(selector);
  // delay traffic from one random replica of the deployment
  const fault = {
    averageDelay: '50ms',
    errorCode: 500,
    errorRate: 0.1,
  };
  podDisruptor.injectHTTPFaults(fault, '30s');
}
```

Notice the following code snippet in the `injectFaults` function above:

```javascript
if (__ENV.SKIP_FAULTS == '1') {
  return;
}
```

This code makes the function return without injecting faults if the `SKIP_FAULTS` environment variable is passed to the execution of the test with a value of "1". We will use this option to obtain a [baseline execution](#baseline-execution) without faults.

## Scenarios

This test defines two [scenarios](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/using-k6/scenarios) to be executed. The `load` scenario applies the test load to the `httpbin` application for `30s` invoking the `default` function. The `disrupt` scenario invokes the `disrupt` function to inject a fault in the HTTP requests of the target application.

```javascript
    scenarios: {
        load: {
            executor: 'constant-arrival-rate',
            rate: 100,
            preAllocatedVUs: 10,
            maxVUs: 100,
            exec: "default",
            startTime: "0s",
            duration: "30s",
        },
        disrupt: {
            executor: 'shared-iterations',
            iterations: 1,
            vus: 1,
            exec: "disrupt",
            startTime: "0s",
        },
    }
```

{{% admonition type="note" %}}

Notice that the `disrupt` scenario uses a `shared-iterations` executor with one iteration and one `VU`. This setting ensures the `disrupt` function is executed only once. Executing this function multiples times concurrently may have unpredictable results.

## Executions

{{% admonition type="note" %}}

The commands in this section assume the `xk6-disruptor` binary is available in your current directory. This location can change depending on the installation process and the platform. Refer to the [installation section](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/injecting-faults-with-xk6-disruptor/installation) for details on how to install it in your environment.

{{% /admonition %}}

### Baseline execution

We will first execute the test without introducing faults to have an baseline using the following command:

{{< code >}}

```bash
xk6-disruptor run --env SKIP_FAULTS=1 --env SVC_IP=$SVC_IP disrupt-pod.js
```

```windows-powershell
xk6-disruptor run --env SKIP_FAULTS=1 --env "SVC_IP=$Env:SVC_IP" disrupt-pod.js
```

{{< /code >}}

Notice the argument `--env SKIP_FAULT=1`, which makes the `disrupt` function return without injecting any fault as explained in the [fault injection](#fault-injection) section. Also notice the `--env SVC_IP` argument, which passes the external IP used to access the `httpbin` application.

You should get an output similar to the one shown below (click `Expand` button to see all output).

### Comparison

Let's take a closer look at the results for the requests on each scenario. We can observe that he `base` scenario has an average of `103ms` and an error rate of `0%` while the `faults` scenario has a median around `151.9ms` and an error rate of nearly `10%`, matching the definition of the faults defined in the disruptor.

| Execution       | Avg. Response | Failed requests |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Baseline        | 103.22ms      | 0.00%           |
| Fault injection | 151.9 ms      | 9.65%           |

{{% admonition type="note" %}}

Notice we have used the average response time reported as `expected_response:true` because this metric only consider successful requests while `http_req_duration` considers all requests, including those returning a fault.

```javascript
import { PodDisruptor } from 'k6/x/disruptor';
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function (data) {
  http.get(`http://${__ENV.SVC_IP}/delay/0.1`);

## Test setup

The tests requires the deployment of the `httpbin` application. The application must also be accessible using an external IP available in the `SVC_IP` environment variable.

The [manifests](#manifests) below define the resources required for deploying the application and exposing it as a LoadBalancer service.

You can deploy the application using the following commands:

```bash
# Create Namespace
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
namespace/httpbin created

# Deploy Pod
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
pod/httpbin created

# Expose Pod as a Service
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
service/httpbin created
```

You can retrieve the resources using the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n httpbin get all
NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/httpbin   1/1     Running   0          1m

NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)        AGE
service/httpbin   LoadBalancer   10.96.169.78   172.18.255.200   80:31224/TCP   1m
```

You must set the environment variable `SVC_IP` with the external IP address and port used to access the `httpbin` service from the test script.

You can learn more about how to get the external IP address in the [expose your application](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/<K6_VERSION>/testing-guides/injecting-faults-with-xk6-disruptor/expose--your-application) section.
