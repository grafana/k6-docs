title: Overview
excerpt: All the ways you can look at k6 results. While the test runs, after the test runs, on an external platform, as summary statistics.
---

k6 emits [metrics](/using-k6/metrics) with timestamps at every point of the test.
You can output the metric results as either **aggregated statistics** or **individual data points**.

- For a top-level test overview, use the [end-of-test summary](../end-of-test).
- For granular output of all metrics (with timestamps), you [stream metrics in real time](../real-time).

If you stream your metrics, you can either write them to a file, like JSON, or stream them to a service, like InfluxDB.
