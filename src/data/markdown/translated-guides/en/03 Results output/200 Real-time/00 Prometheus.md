excerpt: 'The Prometheus integration allows to send test results to any Prometheus Remote Write endpoint.'
---

k6 supports sending test result metrics to a Prometheus Remote Write endpoint via the [`xk6-output-prometheus-remote` extension](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-output-prometheus-remote).  One option with this support is storing the metrics in Prometheus; others can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/).

## Instructions

<InstallationInstructions extensionUrl="github.com/grafana/xk6-output-prometheus-remote"/>


Then run the test with the new binary as follows:


```bash
./k6 run -o output-prometheus-remote script.js
```

All metrics sent by the extension get the prefix `k6_` attached to their names. In case of Prometheus, k6 metrics can be seen in its UI:

If the remote write endpoint requires authentication, the following command can be used:

<CodeGroup labels={[""]}>

```bash
    K6_PROMETHEUS_INSECURE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY=false \
    K6_PROMETHEUS_USER=foo \
    K6_PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD=bar \
    ./k6 run script.js -o output-prometheus-remote
```

</CodeGroup>
