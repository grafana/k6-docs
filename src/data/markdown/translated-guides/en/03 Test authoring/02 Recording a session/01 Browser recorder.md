The browser recorder lets you generate a k6 script based on a web session.
It's available as an extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/k6-browser-recorder/phjdhndljphphehjpgbmpocddnnmdbda?hl=en) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/k6-browser-recorder/).

## k6 Cloud integration

The browser recorder integrates with [k6 Cloud](/cloud).
When you finish recording the session, the extension uploads the auto-generated k6 test into the k6 Cloud account.

> **Note**: **the recorder is free to use**.
>
>You do not need an active k6 Cloud subscription.
> 
> Any user can copy the script from the [script editor](/cloud/creating-and-running-a-test/script-editor) to edit or run the test locally using the `k6 run` command. We also plan to make this feature work without a k6 Cloud account.

The recorder captures every HTTP(s) request loaded into the browser as you click.
This includes including ads, images, documents, etc.

## How to record

1. Install the [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/k6-browser-recorder/phjdhndljphphehjpgbmpocddnnmdbda?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/k6-browser-recorder/) extension.
1. Open the extension by clicking the k6 logo.
1. Select **Start recording** to begin recording the current browser tab.

1. When done, select **Stop recording**. You'll be taken to the app to review the recorded test script.

1. Save the recorded script in any of your projects.
  To include some of the requests in the _third party list_,  deselect the ones you want to include.
  ![Step 4](./images/Recording-a-test-script/step-4.png)
1. Edit your script as necessary. Depending on the type of testing, you might need to change different aspects of the script. 
   Typical changes are for [load options](/using-k6/options) and to handle [correlation and dynamic data](/examples/correlation-and-dynamic-data).
1. Run the test locally or in k6 Cloud.

  - To run a test from the k6 Cloud UI, select **Run** to start the test.
  - To use the k6 CLI to run a local or cloud test, copy the generated script to your local text editor and execute the `k6 run` or `k6 cloud` command to start the test. 

For more about running k6, refer to the [Running k6 guide](/getting-started/running-k6).

## Having trouble? Try the HAR converter

Under the hood, the browser recorder generates the script with the [HAR converter](/test-authoring/recording-a-session/har-converter/).
The HAR converter creates a k6 script from the HTTP requests included in a HAR file.

For certain edge cases, the HAR converter will catch some behavior that the browser recorder won't.
For example, the browser extension won't record other tabs or pop-up windows.

If you need to capture this information or are having a problem recording a request, try the HAR converter.
If the error persists with the HAR converter, please provide detailed information about the problem [in a new issue](https://github.com/k6io/har-to-k6/issues).
