title: Test for functional behavior
excerpt: Use k6 to write requests and assert that they respond correctly
---

In this tutorial, learn how to write a test that:
- Sends a POST request to the new endpoint 
- Creates a check for the response status

## Script the Request

The first thing to do is to add logic for the endpoint.
For that, you need to:
1. Import the HTTP module.
2. Add a payload to authenticate the user.
3. Use the `http.post` method to send your request to an endpoint.

To test, copy this file and save it as `tutorial.js`

<CodeGroup labels={["tutorial.js"]} lineNumbers={[]} showCopyButton={[true]}>

```javascript
// import necessary module
import http from "k6/http";

export default function () {

  // define URL and payload
  const url = "https://test-api.k6.io/auth/basic/login/";
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    username: "test_case",
    password: "1234",
  });

  const params = {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  };

  // send a post request and save response as a variable
  const res = http.post(url, payload, params);
}
``` 

</CodeGroup>

Run the script with `k6 run tutorial.js`.
After the test finishes, k6 logs a summary to the console.
Confirm that the request works, check that the summary numbers look plausible.


To make sure you're getting the right response, you can log `res` to the console.

```
  //add at the end of the default function
  console.log(res);
```

To read about making requests, read the [HTTP requests](/using-k6/http-metrics) guide or the [`http` module](/javascript-api/k6-http/) reference guide.

## Add response checks

Once you're sure the request is well-formed, add a check that validates whether the system responds with the expected body.

Update your script so it has the following check function and run it.
Inspect the output for your check.

<CodeGroup labels={["checks response is 200"]} lineNumbers={["true"]} showCopyButton={[true]}>

```javascript
// Import necessary modules
import { check } from "k6";
import http from "k6/http";

export default function () {
  // define URL and request body
  const url = "https://test-api.k6.io/auth/basic/login/";
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    username: "test_case",
    password: "1234",
  });
  const params = {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  };

  // send a post request and save response as a variable
  const res = http.post(url, payload, params);

  // check that response is 200
  check(res, {
    "response code was 200": (res) => res.status == 200,
  });
}
```

</CodeGroup>


Inspect the result output for your check.
It should looks something like this.

```
âœ“ response code was 200
```

To learn more about using checks, refer to the [Checks](/using-k6/checks) guide.

<Blockquote mod="note" title="">

Under larger loads, this check will fail in some iterations.
**Failed checks do not stop tests.**

Rather, k6 tracks the success rate and presents it in your end of test summary.

</Blockquote>

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you've used k6 to make a POST request and check that it responds with a `200` status.

However, these tests make only one request, which doesn't say much about how the system will respond under load.
For that, you need to increase load.
