**Executors** are the workhorses of the k6 execution engine. Each one
schedules VUs and iterations differently, and you'll choose one depending on the type of traffic you
want to model to test your services.

Possible values for `executor` are the executor name separated by hyphens.

<Blockquote mod="note" title="VUs might not distribute uniformely over iterations">

For any given scenario, you can't guarantee that a specific VU can run a specific iteration.

With [`SharedArray`](/javascript-api/k6-data/sharedarray/) and [execution context variables](/using-k6/execution-context-variables/), you can map a specific VU to a specific value in your test data.
So the tenth VU could use the tenth item in your array (or the sixth iteration to the sixth item).

But, you _cannot_ reliably map, for example, the tenth VU to the tenth iteration.
