## Description

A variable number of VUs execute as many iterations as possible for a specified
amount of time. This executor is equivalent to the global [stages](/using-k6/options#stages) option.

## Options

In addition to the [common configuration options](/using-k6/scenarios#common-options) this executor
also adds the following options:

| Option             | Type    | Description                                                                                    | Default |
| ------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| stages<sup>(required)</sup>          | array   | Array of objects that specify the target number of VUs to ramp up or down to.                  | `[]`    |
| startVUs         | integer | Number of VUs to run at test start.                                                            | `1`     |
| gracefulRampDown | string  | Time to wait for an already started iteration to finish before stopping it during a ramp down. | `"30s"` |

## When to use

This executor is a good fit if you need VUs to ramp up or down during specific periods
of time.

## Example

In this example, we'll run a two-stage test, ramping up from 0 to 10 VUs over 20 seconds, then down
to 0 VUs over 10 seconds.

<CodeGroup labels={[ "ramping-vus.js" ]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  discardResponseBodies: true,
  scenarios: {
    contacts: {
      executor: 'ramping-vus',
      startVUs: 0,
      stages: [
        { duration: '20s', target: 10 },
        { duration: '10s', target: 0 },
      ],
      gracefulRampDown: '0s',
    },
  },
};

export default function () {
  http.get('https://test.k6.io/contacts.php');
  // We're injecting a processing pause for illustrative purposes only!
  // Each iteration will be ~515ms, therefore ~2 iterations/second per VU maximum throughput.
  sleep(0.5);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

> Note the setting of `gracefulRampDown` to 0 seconds, which could cause some iterations to be
interrupted during the ramp down stage.

## Observations

The following graph depicts the performance of the [example](#example) script:

![Ramping VUs](./images/ramping-vus.png)

Based upon our test scenario inputs and results:

* We've defined 2 stages for a total test duration of 30 seconds;
* stage 1 ramps _up_ VUs linearly from the `startVUs` of 0 to the target of 10 over a 20 second duration;
* from the 10 VUs at the end of stage 1, stage 2 then ramps _down_ VUs linearly to the target of 0 over a 10 second duration;
* each _iteration_ of the `default` function is expected to be roughly 515ms, or ~2/s;
* as the number of VUs changes, the iteration rate directly correlates; each addition of a VU increases the rate by \~2 iters/s, whereas each subtraction of a VU reduces by \~2 iters/s;
* our example performed ~300 iterations over the course of the test.

## Get the stage index

To get the current running stage index, use the `getCurrentStageIndex` helper function from the [k6-jslib-utils](/javascript-api/jslib/utils) library. It returns a zero-based number equal to the position in the shortcut `stages` array or in the executor's `stages` array.

```javascript
import { getCurrentStageIndex } from 'https://jslib.k6.io/k6-utils/1.3.0/index.js';

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { target: 10, duration: '30s' },
    { target: 50, duration: '1m' },
    { target: 10, duration: '30s' },
  ],
};

export default function () {
  if (getCurrentStageIndex() === 1) {
    console.log('Running the second stage where the expected target is 50');
  }
}
```

Using this feature, it is possible to automatically tag using the current running stage. Check the [Tagging stages](/using-k6/tags-and-groups/#tagging-stages) section for more details.
