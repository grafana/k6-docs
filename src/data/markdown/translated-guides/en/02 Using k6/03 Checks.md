## What is a check?

[Checks](/javascript-api/k6/check-val-sets-tags/) are like assertions, but differ in that they don't halt the execution. Instead, they store the result of the check, pass or fail, and let the script execution continue. Take a look at [thresholds](/using-k6/thresholds) for a way to halt the execution of a test based on checks.

### Check for HTTP response code returned

Checks are great for codifying assertions relating to HTTP requests/responses, such as making sure the response code is an HTTP 2xx:

<CodeGroup lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import { check } from 'k6';
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://test.k6.io/');
  check(res, {
    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
  });
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Check for text in response body returned

Sometimes, even an HTTP 200 response can contain an error message. In these situations, consider adding a check to verify the response body, like this:

<CodeGroup lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import { check } from 'k6';
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://test.k6.io/');
  check(res, {
    'verify homepage text': (r) =>
      r.body.includes('Collection of simple web-pages suitable for load testing'),
  });
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Check for response body size

If you want to verify that the response to a request that k6 sends is of a certain size, you can use a check for that like this:

<CodeGroup lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import { check } from 'k6';
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://test.k6.io/');
  check(res, {
    'body size is 11,105 bytes': (r) => r.body.length == 11105,
  });
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Check output

When you run a script including checks, you can see the outcome of the check calls in the following output:

<CodeGroup lineNumbers={[false]}>

```bash
$ k6 run script.js

  ...
    ✓ is status 200

  ...
  checks.........................: 100.00% ✓ 1        ✗ 0
  data_received..................: 11 kB   12 kB/s
```

</CodeGroup>

In the output above you can see that our check "is status 200" was successful 100% of the times it was called.

### Adding multiple checks

You may also add multiple checks within a single [check()](/javascript-api/k6/check-val-sets-tags) statement, like this:

<CodeGroup lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import { check } from 'k6';
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://test.k6.io/');
  check(res, {
    'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'body size is 11,105 bytes': (r) => r.body.length == 11105,
  });
}
```

</CodeGroup>

When this test is executed, the output will look like this:

<CodeGroup lineNumbers={[false]}>

```bash
$ k6 run checks.js

  ...
    ✓ is status 200
    ✓ body size is 11,105 bytes

  ...
  checks.........................: 100.00% ✓ 2        ✗ 0
  data_received..................: 11 kB   20 kB/s
```

</CodeGroup>

> #### About Failing Checks
>
> When a check fails, the script will continue executing successfully and will not return a 'failed' exit status.
> If you need the whole test to fail based on the results of a check, you have to [combine checks with thresholds](/using-k6/thresholds/#failing-a-load-test-using-checks).
> This is particularly useful in specific contexts, such as integrating k6 into your CI pipelines or receiving alerts when scheduling your performance tests.

## Checks in k6 Cloud Results

In [k6 Cloud Results](/cloud/analyzing-results/overview) `Checks` are available in their [own tab](/cloud/analyzing-results/checks-tab) for analysis.

Here we can quickly see what checks are failing, and upon clicking on any check, see the count of passes/failures
at given points in the test. You can also add the check to the analysis tab, for further comparison with other metrics.
