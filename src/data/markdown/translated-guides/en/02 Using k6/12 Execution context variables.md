title: 'Execution context variables'
excerpt: 'k6/execution module provides the capability to get information about the current test execution state inside the test script'
canonicalUrl: https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/execution-context-variables/
---
In some cases, it's really useful to have information about the script's current test-execution state. For example, you might want to
- Have different VUs run different test logic
- Use different data for each VU and iteration
- Figure out the stage that a test is in

To solve these issues, you can use *execution context variables*.

## k6/execution

The [k6/execution](/javascript-api/k6-execution) module exposes details about the current execution state, such as _the name of the currently executed scenario_, _how many VUs are currently active_, and more.
The module provides test-execution information via three properties:

| Property                                           | Meta-information and execution details about                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [instance](/javascript-api/k6-execution/#instance) | The current running k6 instance  |
| [scenario](/javascript-api/k6-execution/#scenario) | The current running scenario    |
| [vu](/javascript-api/k6-execution/#vu)             | The current VU and iteration    |

> k6 v0.34.0 introduced the **k6/execution** module.
> If you are using a version k6 that does not have this module,
> refer to the [\_\_VU and \_\_ITER](/using-k6/execution-context-variables/#__vu-and-__iter-discouraged) section.


## Example: log all context variables

If you want to experiment with what each context variable looks like as a test runs,
you can copy this template literal into one of your test scripts.

Note that this omits the `abort` variable, since that function would abort the test.

<CodeGroup labels={["Log all execution variables"]} lineNumbers={[true]} showCopyButton={[true]}>

```javascript
import exec from 'k6/execution';

export default function () {
  console.log(`Execution context

Instance info
-------------
Vus active: ${exec.instance.vusActive}
Iterations completed: ${exec.instance.iterationsCompleted}
Iterations interrupted:  ${exec.instance.iterationsInterrupted}
Iterations active:  ${exec.instance.vusActive}
Initialized vus:  ${exec.instance.vusInitialized}
Time passed from start of run(ms):  ${exec.instance.currentTestRunDuration}

Scenario info
-------------
Name of the running scenario: ${exec.scenario.name}

Iteration in test: ${exec.scenario.iterationInTest}

Test info

All test options: ${exec.test.options}

VU info
-------
Iteration id: ${exec.vu.iterationInInstance}
Iteration in scenario: ${exec.vu.iterationInScenario}

VU ID in test: ${exec.vu.idInTest}
VU tags: ${exec.vu.tags}`);
}
```

## Examples and use cases

- [Getting unique data once](/examples/data-parameterization#retrieving-unique-data)
- [Timing operations](/javascript-api/k6-execution/#timing-operations)
- [Executing different code blocks](/javascript-api/k6-execution/#script-naming)

<Collapsible title="_VU and _ITER (discouraged)" tag="h2">

⚠️  **\_\_VU** and **\_\_ITER** are both global variables with execution-context information that k6 makes available to the test script.

### \_\_ITER

A numeric counter with the current iteration number for a specific VU. Zero-based.

### \_\_VU

Current VU number in use. k6 assigns the value incrementally for each new VU instance, starting from one.
The variable is 0 when executing the setup and teardown functions.

### Running in k6 Cloud

When you run tests in [k6 Cloud](/cloud), the **\_\_VU** value is per server/load generator.
Read the details in the [cloud docs](/cloud/cloud-reference/cloud-ips/#vu-per-tier).

### Examples

<CodeGroup labels={[]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';
export default function () {
  http.get('http://test.k6.io');
  console.log(`VU: ${__VU}  -  ITER: ${__ITER}`);
  sleep(1);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

You can use execution-context variables to configure different test behaviors and parameterizations.
A typical use case is a load test that simulates different users performing a login flow.

<CodeGroup labels={[]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';
export default function () {
  const email = `user+${__VU}@mail.com`;
  const payload = JSON.stringify({ email: email, password: 'test' });
  const params = { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } };
  http.post('http://test.k6.io/login', payload, params);
  console.log(email);
  // .. continue the user flow
  sleep(1);
}
```

## k6 Cloud environment variables

If you run tests in k6 Cloud, you have additional environment variables that tell you the server, load zone, and distribution of the currently running test.
[Read about cloud environment variables](/cloud/creating-and-running-a-test/cloud-scripting-extras/cloud-environment-variables).
