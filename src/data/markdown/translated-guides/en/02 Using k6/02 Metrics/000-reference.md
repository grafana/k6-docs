excerpt: A reference of built-in metrics for different supported protocols.

Every k6 test emits built-in and [Custom metrics](/using-k6/metrics/create-custom).
Each supported protocol also has its specific metrics.

## Standard built-in metrics.

k6 always collects the following metrics, no matter what protocol the test uses:

| Metric Name        | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vus                | Gauge   | Current number of active virtual users                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| vus_max            | Gauge   | Max possible number of virtual users (VU resources are [pre-allocated](/using-k6/scenarios/concepts/arrival-rate-vu-allocation/), to avoid affecting performance when scaling up load )                                                                                                              |
| iterations         | Counter | The aggregate number of times the VUs execute the JS script (the `default` function).                                                                                                                                                                        |
| iteration_duration | Trend   | The time to complete one full iteration, including time spent in `setup` and `teardown`. To calculate the duration of the iteration's function for the specific scenario, [try this workaround](/using-k6/workaround-to-calculate-iteration_duration) |
| dropped_iterations | Counter | The number of iterations that weren't started due to lack of VUs (for the arrival-rate executors) or lack of time (expired maxDuration in the iteration-based executors). [About dropped iterations](/using-k6/scenarios/concepts/dropped-iterations/)                                                                             |
| data_received      | Counter | The amount of received data. [This example covers how to track data for an individual URL](/examples/track-transmitted-data-per-url).                                                                                                                         |
| data_sent          | Counter | The amount of data sent. [Track data for an individual URL](/examples/track-transmitted-data-per-url) to track data for an individual URL.                                                                                                                                   |
| checks             | Rate    | The rate of successful checks.

## HTTP-specific built-in metrics

These metrics are generated only when the test makes HTTP requests.

<Blockquote mod="note" title="">

For all `http_req_*` metrics, **the timestamp is emitted the end of the request.**
In other words, the timestamp happens when k6 receives the end of the response body, or the request times out.

## Built-in gRPC metrics

k6 emits the following metrics when it interacts with a service through the [`gRPC`](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6-net-grpc/) API.
