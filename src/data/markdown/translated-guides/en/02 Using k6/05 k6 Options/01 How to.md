Your use case will likely determine how you want to set options.
You can also access option values as your test runs.

## Where to set options

For most options, k6 provides multiple ways to set them:

- In CLI flags
- In environment variables
- In the config file
- In the script `options` object

You can also set an option in one place and override it somewhere else (according to the [order of precedence](../#order-of-precedence)).
Sometimes, how you set options is a matter of personal preference.
Other times, your situation will dictate the best place to put your options.

CLI options are good setting options on the fly.
Of course, you can configure options in multiple places.
For example, you might want to set your stages in the script options, then use CLI flags to run the script with different duration times.

Environment variables often work well when you need to set your options from some other part of your DevOps build chain.
For example, you could derive the option from a variable in your Docker container definition, CI UI, vault&mdash;wherever you declare environment variables.
The [block hostnames](#block-hostnames) option is an option that works well with environment variables.

You can version control your options (and keep your tests tidy) by setting them in your script or config file.
You may wonder why you would need a config file when you can use the script options.
Isn't this redundant?
There are multiple reasons k6 offers a config file.
For one, k6 uses the (autogenerated) config file to keep users logged in after they run `k6 login cloud`.

Other reasons for config files are more about developer style and comfort:
- To separate the test configuration from JavaScript code
- To reduce the size of the entry-point script, especially when there are multiple scenarios
- To more easily switch between configs (either rename the current config file or modify the JavaScript code in one location)


## Examples of setting options

The following JS snippets show some examples of how you can set options.

### Options in the script

<CodeGroup labels={["example.js"]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';

export const options = {
  hosts: { 'test.k6.io': '1.2.3.4' },
  stages: [
    { duration: '1m', target: 10 },
    { duration: '1m', target: 20 },
    { duration: '1m', target: 0 },
  ],
  thresholds: { http_req_duration: ['avg<100', 'p(95)<200'] },
  noConnectionReuse: true,
  userAgent: 'MyK6UserAgentString/1.0',
};

export default function () {
  http.get('http://test.k6.io/');
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Options in a config file

<div id="config-json-example">
You can also define the same options through a config file:
</div>

<CodeGroup labels={["config.json"]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```json
{
  "hosts": {
    "test.k6.io": "1.2.3.4"
  },
  "stages": [
    {
      "duration": "1m",
      "target": 10
    },
    {
      "duration": "1m",
      "target": 30
    },
    {
      "duration": "1m",
      "target": 0
    }
  ],
  "thresholds": {
    "http_req_duration": ["avg<100", "p(95)<200"]
  },
  "noConnectionReuse": true,
  "userAgent": "MyK6UserAgentString/1.0"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Options with environment variables

Set some of the previous options via environment variables and command-line flags:

<CodeGroup labels={["Bash", "Windows: CMD", "Windows: PowerShell"]} lineNumbers={[false]}>

```bash
$ K6_NO_CONNECTION_REUSE=true K6_USER_AGENT="MyK6UserAgentString/1.0" k6 run script.js

$ k6 run --no-connection-reuse --user-agent "MyK6UserAgentString/1.0" script.js
```

```bash
C:\k6> set "K6_NO_CONNECTION_REUSE=true" && set "K6_USER_AGENT=MyK6UserAgentString/1.0" && k6 run script.js

C:\k6> k6 run --no-connection-reuse --user-agent "MyK6UserAgentString/1.0" script.js
```

```bash
PS C:\k6> $env:K6_NO_CONNECTION_REUSE=true; $env:K6_USER_AGENT="MyK6UserAgentString/1.0"; k6 run script.js

PS C:\k6> k6 run --no-connection-reuse --user-agent "MyK6UserAgentString/1.0" script.js
```

</CodeGroup>

## Get an option value from the script

The `k6/execution` API provides a [test.options](/javascript-api/k6-execution/#test) object.
With `test.options`, you can access the final, consolidated, and derived options of your script as the test runs.

A common use is to grab the value of a tag.
It also can be handy to get stage values.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import exec from 'k6/execution';

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '5s', target: 100 },
    { duration: '5s', target: 50 },
  ],
};

export default function () {
  console.log(exec.test.options.scenarios.default.stages[0].target); // 100
}
```
