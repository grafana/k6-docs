<dt id="application-performance-monitoring">Application performance monitoring</dt>
<dd>*(Or APM)*. The practice of monitoring the performance, availability, and reliability of a system. When running load tests, Grafana is an example of a compatible APM service, as users can use Grafana to monitor the load test from the side of the system under test.
<p>Read more: [k6 cloud has built-in support to export to a few APM services](https://k6.io/docs/cloud/integrations/cloud-apm/).</p></dd>

<dt id="concurrency">Concurrency</dt>
<dd>When multiple computations happen at the same time.
In the context of k6, virtual users can make concurrent requests as a test runs. In k6 cloud, you can also run multiple tests concurrently.</dd>

<dt id="correlation">Correlation</dt>
<dd>The process of taking [dynamic data](#dynamic-data) received from the system under test then reusing the data in a subsequent request. Testers commonly use correlation to retrieve and reuse session IDs or tokens for a [virtual user](#virtual-user)'s iteration lifetime.
<p>Read more: [Correlation and dynamic data example](https://k6.io/docs/examples/correlation-and-dynamic-data/), [Correlation in testing APIs](https://k6.io/docs/testing-guides/api-load-testing/#correlation-and-data-parameterization)</p></dd>

<dt id="checks">Checks</dt>
<dd>Conditions that validate the correctness of a service.
In k6 scripts, checks are a function that validates a response to a test request.
<p>Read more: [Checks reference](/using-k6/checks)</p></dd>

<dt id="duration">Duration</dt>
<dd>The length of time that a test runs. When duration is set as an option, VU code runs for as many iterations as possible in the length of time specified (with possible finishing time given as a [graceful stop](#graceful-stop).
<p>Read more: [Duration option reference](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/k6-options/reference/#duration)</p></dd>

<dt id="dynamic-data">Dynamic data</dt>
<dd>Data that might, or will, change between test runs. Common examples are order IDs, session tokens, or timestamps.
<p>Read more: [Correlation and dynamic data example](https://k6.io/docs/examples/correlation-and-dynamic-data/)</p></dd>

<dt id="endurance-testing">Endurance testing</dt>
<dd>A synonym for [soak testing](#soak-test).</dd>

<dt id="executor">Executor</dt>
<dd>An property of a [scenario](#scenario) that configures VU behavior. You can use executors to configure whether to designate iterations as shared between VUs or to run per VU, or to configure or whether the VU concurrency is constant or changing</dd>

<dt id="goja">Goja</dt>
<dd>A JavaScript runtime, written in pure Go, that emphasizes standard compliance and performance. k6 uses Goja to enable test scripting without compromising speed, efficiency or reliability, compromises that would have been necessary with NodeJS
<p>Read more: [Goja repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dop251/goja).</p></dd>

<dt id="graceful-stop">Graceful stop</dt>
<dd>A period that lets VUs finish an iteration at the end of a load test. Graceful stops prevent abrupt halts in execution, and graceful ramp downs prevent unrealistic drops to zero VUs.

<dt id="service-level-indicator">Service-level indicator</dt>
<dd>*(Or SLI)*. A metric that measures whether a service meets its [service-level objective](#service-level-objective). In performance monitoring, and SLI could be the number of successful requests against the service during a specified period.</dd>

<dt id="service-level-objective">Service-level objective</dt>
<dd>*(Or SLO)*. An actual target, either internal or part of the [service-level agreement](#service-level-agreement), for the availability of the service. This is often expressed as a percentage (99,2%, for instance). If the service meets or exceeds this target, it's within its "error budget"</dd>

<dt id="smoke-test">Smoke test</dt>
<dd>A test that verifies whether the system under test can handle a minimal amount of load without any issues. Testers commonly use smoke tests to make sure that everything works as intended under optimal conditions. After the smoke test, they can advance to any of the other performance test types.
