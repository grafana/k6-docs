A smoke test is a regular load test, configured for minimal load.

Each time you run a new script, it's a good idea to run a smoke to test first, which helps you
- Verify that your test script doesn't have errors.
- Verify that your system doesn't throw any errors when under minimal load.

## Smoke testing in k6

Below you find a sample smoke test script to get you started. You can copy it, change the end points and start testing.
If you would like to see more comprehensive script, check out our [example section](/examples).

<CodeGroup labels={["sample-smoke-test.js"]} lineNumbers={[true]} heightTogglers={[true]}>

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, group, sleep, fail } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  vus: 1, // 1 user looping for 1 minute
  duration: '1m',

  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(99)<1500'], // 99% of requests must complete below 1.5s
  },
};

const BASE_URL = 'https://test-api.k6.io';
const USERNAME = 'TestUser';
const PASSWORD = 'SuperCroc2020';

export default () => {
  const loginRes = http.post(`${BASE_URL}/auth/token/login/`, {
    username: USERNAME,
    password: PASSWORD,
  });

  check(loginRes, {
    'logged in successfully': (resp) => resp.json('access') !== '',
  });

  const authHeaders = {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${loginRes.json('access')}`,
    },
  };

  const myObjects = http.get(`${BASE_URL}/my/crocodiles/`, authHeaders).json();
  check(myObjects, { 'retrieved crocodiles': (obj) => obj.length > 0 });

  sleep(1);
};
```

The VU chart of a smoke test should look similar to this. You want to use only 1 or 2 VUs.

If your smoke test produced any errors, you should either correct the script or fix your environment
before you continue.

The k6 output should look similar to this:
![Smoke test Terminal Output](./images/smoke-test-terminal-output.png)

Once your smoke test shows 0 errors, as on the screenshot above, you can go to the next step and execute a [load test](/test-types/load-testing) to assess the performance of your system.
