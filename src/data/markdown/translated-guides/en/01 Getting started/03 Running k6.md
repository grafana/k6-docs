Follow along to learn how to:
1. Run a test.
2. Add virtual users.
3. Increase the test duration. 
4. Ramp the number of requests up and down as the test runs.

With these example snippets, you'll run the test with your machine's resources.
But, if you have a cloud account, you can also use the `k6 cloud` command to outsource the test to our cloud servers. 

## Running local tests

Let's start by running a simple local script.
Copy the code below, paste it into your favorite editor, and save it as `script.js`:

<CodeGroup labels={["script.js"]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  http.get('https://test.k6.io');
  sleep(1);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Then, run k6 with this command:

<CodeGroup labels={["CLI", "Docker", "Docker in Win PowerShell"]}>

```bash
$ k6 run script.js
```

```bash
# When using the `k6` docker image, you can't just give the script name since
# the script file will not be available to the container as it runs. Instead
# you must tell k6 to read `stdin` by passing the file name as `-`. Then you
# pipe the actual file into the container with `<` or equivalent. This will
# cause the file to be redirected into the container and be read by k6.

$ docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run - <script.js
```

```bash
PS C:\> cat script.js | docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run -
```

</CodeGroup>

## Adding more VUs

Now let's run a load test with more than one virtual user and a longer duration:

<CodeGroup labels={["CLI", "Docker", "Docker in Win PowerShell"]}>

```bash
$ k6 run --vus 10 --duration 30s script.js
```

```bash
$ docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run --vus 10 --duration 30s - <script.js
```

```bash
PS C:\> cat script.js | docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run --vus 10 --duration 30s -
```

</CodeGroup>

_Running a 30-second, 10-VU load test_

k6 works with the concept of _virtual users_ (VUs), which run your test scripts.
VUs are essentially
glorified, parallel `while(true)` loops.
Scripts are written using JavaScript, as ES6 modules,
which allows you to break larger tests into smaller pieces or make reusable pieces as you like.

Scripts must contain, at the very least, a `default` function.
This function defines the entry point for your VUs, similar to the `main()` function in many other languages:

<CodeGroup labels={[]}>

```javascript
export default function () {
  // vu code: do things here...
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### The init context and the default function

You might ask: "Why not just run my script normally, from top to bottom?"  The answer is: we do, but code inside and outside your default function can do different things.

Code _inside_ `default` is *VU code*.
It runs over and over for as long as the test is running.
Code _outside_ of `default` is *init code*.
It's run only once per VU.

<CodeGroup labels={[""]}>

```javascript
// init code

export default function () {
  // vu code
}
```

</CodeGroup>

VU code can make HTTP requests, emit metrics, and generally do everything you'd expect a load test
to do.
There are a few important exceptions: you can't:
* Load anything from your local filesystem
* Import any other modules.

Instead, do these from init-code.

Read more about the different [life cycle stages of a k6 test](/using-k6/test-life-cycle).

## Using options

Instead of typing `--vus 10` and `--duration 30s` each time you run the script,
you can include the options in your JavaScript file:

<CodeGroup labels={["script.js"]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';
export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: '30s',
};
export default function () {
  http.get('http://test.k6.io');
  sleep(1);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Then, run the script without those options on the command line:

<CodeGroup labels={["CLI", "Docker", "Docker in Win PowerShell"]}>

```bash
$ k6 run script.js
```

```bash
$ docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run - <script.js
```

```bash
PS C:\> cat script.js | docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run -
```

</CodeGroup>

## Stages: ramping up/down VUs

You can ramp the number of VUs up and down during the test.
To configure ramping, use the `options.stages` property.


<CodeGroup labels={["stages.js"]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '30s', target: 20 },
    { duration: '1m30s', target: 10 },
    { duration: '20s', target: 0 },
  ],
};

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('https://httpbin.test.k6.io/');
  check(res, { 'status was 200': (r) => r.status == 200 });
  sleep(1);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

To configure advanced ramping, you can use [scenarios](/using-k6/scenarios) and the `ramping-vus` executor.

## Running cloud tests

k6 supports three test-execution modes:

- [Local](#running-local-tests): on your local machine or a CI server.
- [Cloud](/cloud): on cloud infrastructure managed by k6 Cloud.
- Clustered: on more than one machine managed by you. [Not supported yet](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/140).

k6 has a goal of letting you run a test in all three execution modes without modifying the script.

To run cloud tests from the CLI:
1. Register a k6 Cloud account.
2. Log in to your account via the CLI.
3. Use the `k6 cloud` command to run the script you already have.

<CodeGroup labels={["Running a cloud test"]}>

```bash
$ k6 cloud script.js
```
