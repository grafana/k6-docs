The k6 docs aim to cover everything you need to know about using the core k6 products in your daily operational work.
But skills take time to develop.
What's more, k6 is an extensible application, so many of its use cases incorporate other tools.

These resources help you write and run k6 tests in a safe environment, and explore how to use k6 with other applications.
