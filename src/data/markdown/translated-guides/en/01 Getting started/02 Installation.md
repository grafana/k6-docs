## Linux

### Debian/Ubuntu

> #### 🧠 If you are using an image that lacks `ca-certificates` or `gnupg2`
> 
> Some images don't come bundled with the `ca-certificates` and `gnupg2` packages
> out of the box. If you are using such an image, you first need to install these
> packages with the following command:
> 
> ```bash
> $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ca-certificates gnupg2 -y
> ```

```bash
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys C5AD17C747E3415A3642D57D77C6C491D6AC1D69
$ echo "deb https://dl.k6.io/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/k6.list
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install k6
```

> #### ⚠️ If you are behind a firewall or proxy
>
> There have been reports of users being unable to download the key from Ubuntu's
> keyserver using the `apt-key` command due to firewalls or proxies blocking their
> requests. If you experience this issue, you may try this alternative approach
> instead:
>
> ```bash
> $ curl -s https://dl.k6.io/key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
> ```
>
> Then confirm that the key with the above ID is shown in the output of `sudo apt-key list`.


### Fedora/CentOS

Using `dnf` or `yum` on older versions:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install https://dl.k6.io/rpm/repo.rpm
$ sudo dnf install k6
```

CentOS versions older than 8 don't support the PGP V4 signature we use, so you'll need to disable the verification by installing k6 with:
```bash
$ sudo yum install --nogpgcheck k6
```

> #### ⚠️ Note about Bintray
>
> The Bintray k6 repositories will [stop working after May 1st, 2021](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/)
> and you should switch to our own repositories following the instructions above.
>
> On Debian/Ubuntu you can remove the Bintray repository with:
> ```bash
> $ sudo sed -i '/dl\.bintray\.com\/loadimpact\/deb/d' /etc/apt/sources.list
> $ sudo apt-key del 379CE192D401AB61
> $ sudo apt-get update
> ```
>
> And on Fedora/CentOS with:
> ```bash
> $ sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/bintray-loadimpact-rpm.repo
> ```


## macOS

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
$ brew install k6
```

## Windows

If you use the [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/) you can install the unofficial k6 package with:

```
choco install k6
```

Otherwise you can manually download and install the [latest official `.msi` package](https://dl.k6.io/msi/k6-latest-amd64.msi).

## Binaries

Download a prebuilt binary from our [Releases page](https://github.com/k6io/k6/releases),
and place it in your `PATH` to run `k6` from any location.

## Docker

```bash
$ docker pull loadimpact/k6
```
