excerpt: 'An overview of the k6 resources beyond the k6 docs: videos, repositories, test servers, courses, and more'
slug: '/getting-started/resources/'
---

The docs aim to cover everything necessary to use the core k6 products in your daily operational work.
But scripting and testing are skills that take time to learn.
What's more, k6 is an extensible application, already incorporated with many other tools and protocols.

These resources help you write and run k6 tests in a safe environment and explore how to use k6 with other applications.
