#### An extension with much better and standard API exists

[xk6-websockets](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-websockets) implements [the WebSockets API living standard](https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org/). While the implementation isn't full, it uses a global event loop instead of local one.

Currently, it's available as an experimental module [`k6/experimental/websockets`](/javascript-api/k6-experimental/websockets/). It is also likely that it will at some point become part of the core of k6.

The ws module provides a [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) client implementing the [WebSocket protocol](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.txt).
