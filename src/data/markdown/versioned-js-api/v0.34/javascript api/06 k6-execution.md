title: "k6/execution"
excerpt: "Get information about the current test's execution state."
---

k6 v0.34.0 introduced the capability to get information about the current test execution state inside the test script. You can now read in your script the execution state during the test execution and change your script logic based on the current state.

The `k6/execution` module provides the test execution information with the following three properties:

- [instance](#instance)
- [scenario](#scenario)
- [vu](#vu)

<div class="code-group" data-props='{"labels": [], "lineNumbers": [true]}'>

```javascript
import exec from 'k6/execution';

const options = {
  scenarios: {
    myscenario: {
      // this will be the returned name
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      maxDuration: '30m',
    },
  },
};

export default function () {
  console.log(exec.scenario.name); // myscenario
}
```

</div>

> ℹ️ **Identifiers**
>
> All unique identifiers are sequentially generated starting from a base of zero (iterations) or one (VU IDs). In distributed/cloud test runs, the test-wide iteration numbers and VU identifiers are still going to be unique across instances, though there might be gaps in the sequences when, for example, some instances execute faster iterations than others or allocate more VUs mid-test.


### instance

The instance object provides information associated with the load generator instance. You can think of it as the current running k6 process, which will likely be a single process if you are running k6 on your local machine. When running a cloud/distributed test with multiple load generator instances, the values of the following properties can differ across instances.

| Field                  | Type    | Description                                                              |
|------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| iterationsInterrupted  | integer | The number of prematurely interrupted iterations in the current instance. |
| iterationsCompleted    | integer | The number of completed iterations in the current instance. |
| vusActive              | integer | The number of active VUs. |
| vusInitialized         | integer | The number of currently initialized VUs. |
| currentTestRunDuration | float   | The time passed from the start of the current test run in milliseconds. |

### scenario

Meta information and execution details about the current running [scenario](/using-k6/scenarios).

| Field               | Type    | Description                                                              |
|---------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name                | string  | The assigned name of the running scenario. |
| executor            | string  | The name of the running [Executor](/using-k6/scenarios/#executors) type. |
| startTime           | integer | The Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the scenario started. |
| progress            | float   | Percentage in a 0 to 1 interval of the scenario progress. |
| iterationInInstance | integer | The unique and zero-based sequential number of the current iteration in the scenario, across the current instance. |
| iterationInTest     | integer | The unique and zero-based sequential number of the current iteration in the scenario. It is unique in all k6 execution modes - in local, cloud and distributed/segmented test runs. However, while every instance will get non-overlapping index values in cloud/distributed tests, they might iterate over them at different speeds, so the values won't be sequential across them. |


### vu

Meta information and execution details about the current vu and iteration.

| Field               | Type    | Description                                                              |
|---------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| iterationInInstance | integer | The identifier of the iteration in the current instance. |
| iterationInScenario | integer | The identifier of the iteration in the current scenario. |
| idInInstance        | integer | The identifier of the VU across the instance. |
| idInTest            | integer | The globally unique (across the whole test run) identifier of the VU. |

## Examples and use cases

### Getting unique data once

This is a common use case for data parameterization, you can read the [examples](/examples/data-parameterization#retrieving-unique-data) using `scenario.iterationInTest` and `vu.idInTest`.

### Timing operations

The `startTime` property from the `scenario` object can be used to time operations.

<CodeGroup labels={["timing-operations.js"]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import exec from 'k6/execution';

export default function () {
  // do some long operations
  // ...
  console.log(`step1: scenario ran for ${new Date() - new Date(exec.scenario.startTime)}ms`);

  // some more long operations
  //...
  console.log(`step2: scenario ran for ${new Date() - new Date(exec.scenario.startTime)}ms`);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Script naming
The `name` property can be used for executing the logic based on which script is currently running.

> **Tip**:
> If you need to run [multiple scenarios](/using-k6/scenarios/advanced-examples/#using-multiple-scenarios) in your script you can use `exec` option achieve a similar goal

<CodeGroup labels={["script-naming.js"]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import exec from 'k6/execution';

const options = {
  scenarios: {
    'the-first': {
      // ...
    },
    'the-second': {
      // ...
    },
  },
};

export default function () {
  if (exec.scenario.name === 'the-first') {
    // do some logic during this scenario
  } else {
    // do some other logic in the others
  }
}
```
