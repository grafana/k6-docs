Returns a callback to be used with [setResponseCallback](/javascript-api/k6-http/setresponsecallback) to mark responses as expected based only on their status codes.

| Parameter | Type            | Description                                                                                                    |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| statuses  | integer/objects | either an integer or an object like {min:100, max:300} which gives a minimum and maximum expected status codes |

You can have as many arguments as wanted in any order.

### Example

<CodeGroup labels={["expected-statuses-test.js"]}>

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';

// setting some pretty strange status codes as expected
http.setResponseCallback(
  http.expectedStatuses(406, 500, { min: 200, max: 204 }, 302, {
    min: 305,
    max: 405,
  })
);

export default () => {
  // this one will actually be marked as failed as it doesn't match any of the above listed status
  // codes
  http.get('https://httpbin.test.k6.io/status/205');
};
```
