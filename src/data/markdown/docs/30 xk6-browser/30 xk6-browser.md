[xk6-browser](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser) brings browser automation and end-to-end web testing to k6 while supporting core k6 features. It adds browser-level scripting APIs to interact with real browsers and collect frontend metrics as part of your k6 tests.

## Installation

xk6-browser is currently being developed as a [k6 extension](/extensions). You have to run a k6 version built with the browser extension to use the [browser-level APIs](#browser-level-apis) in your k6 tests.

### Download a release binary

The quickest way to get started is to [download a release binary from GitHub](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/releases).

We suggest this option if you don't want to build your own binary with [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6), which can be challenging in some cases.

### Build from source

If you're more adventurous or want to get the latest changes of the xk6-browser extension, you can also build a binary from source.

To build a binary with the extension:
1. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
2. Run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
# Install xk6
go install go.k6.io/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest

# Build the xk6-browser binary
xk6 build --output xk6-browser --with github.com/grafana/xk6-browser

... [INFO] Build environment ready
... [INFO] Building k6
... [INFO] Build complete: xk6-browser
```

xk6 will create the `xk6-browser` binary in the current working directory.


## Your First Test

The first step is to import the `chromium` [BrowserType](/javascript-api/xk6-browser/browsertype), and use its `launch` method to start up a Chromium [Browser](/javascript-api/xk6-browser/browser) process (which is currently the only available `BrowserType`). After it starts, you can interact with it using the [browser-level APIs](#browser-level-apis).

### Example

<CodeGroup labels={[]}>

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```javascript
import { chromium } from 'k6/x/browser';

export default function () {
  const browser = chromium.launch({
    headless: false,
    slowMo: '500ms',
  });

  const context = browser.newContext();
  const page = context.newPage();
  page.goto('https://test.k6.io/browser.php/');
  page.screenshot({ path: `example-chromium.png` });

  page.close();
  browser.close();
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Running the Example Test

If you have downloaded the pre-built binary you will find the binary named `xk6-browser`. Using the [example](#example), create a new file (such as `browser_test.js`) in the same directory as the pre-built binary, and paste the example in that file. Now run:

```
./xk6-browser run browser_test.js
```

<Blockquote mod="note" title="">

The `./` prefix tells your shell to run the binary located in the current working directory. This is required on macOS and Linux, but not on the Windows `cmd.exe` shell. On PowerShell, specify `.\xk6-browser` instead.

If you installed xk6-browser with a system package, or placed the binary in a directory that's part of your `$PATH` environment variable, you can omit the `./` or `.\` prefixes.

## Module Properties

Listed in the table are the importable properties from the top level module (`'k6/x/browser'`).

| Property | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| chromium | A [BrowserType](/javascript-api/xk6-browser/browsertype) to launch tests in a Chromium-based browser.                                                                                |
| devices  | Returns predefined emulation settings for many end-user devices that can be used to simulate browser behavior on a mobile device. See the [devices example](#devices-example) below. |
| version  | Returns the version number of xk6-browser.                                                                                                                                           |

### Devices Example

<CodeGroup labels={[]}>

<!-- eslint-skip -->

```javascript
import { chromium, devices } from 'k6/x/browser';

export default function () {
  const browser = chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const iphoneX = devices['iPhone X'];
  const context = browser.newContext(iphoneX);
  const page = context.newPage();

  page.goto('https://test.k6.io/browser.php/', {
    waitUntil: 'networkidle',
  });

  page.close();
  browser.close();
}
```

## Browser-level APIs

`xk6-browser` uses [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) (CDP) to instrument and interact with the browser. The `xk6-browser` APIs aim for rough compatibility with the [Playwright API for NodeJS](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright).

Note that because k6 does not run in NodeJS, `xk6-browser` APIs will slightly differ from their Playwright counterparts.
