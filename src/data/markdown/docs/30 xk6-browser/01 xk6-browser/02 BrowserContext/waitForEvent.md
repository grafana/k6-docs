This method is a Work In Progress. It requires async functionality and returning a `Promise` to be useful in scripts.

Consider using sync methods [Page.waitForNavigation()](/javascript-api/xk6-browser/page/waitfornavigation) and [Page.waitForSelector()](/javascript-api/xk6-browser/page/waitforselector) instead.

Waits for the event to fire and passes its value into the predicate function. Returns the event data value when the predicate returns `true`.

| Parameter | Type   | Description                               |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| event     | string | Name of event to wait for. **NOTE**: Currently this argument is disregarded, and `waitForEvent` will always wait for `'close'` or `'page'` events. |
| optionsOrPredicate | function\|object | Optional. If it's a function, the `'page'` event data will be passed to it and it must return `true` to continue. |
| optionsOrPredicate.predicate | function | Function that will be called when the `'page'` event is emitted. The event data will be passed to it and it must return `true` to continue. |
| optionsOrPredicate.timeout | number | Maximum time to wait in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30s). Pass `0` to disable timeout. |
