[xk6-browser](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser) brings browser automation and end-to-end web testing to k6 while supporting core k6 features. It adds browser-level scripting APIs to interact with real browsers and collect frontend metrics as part of your k6 tests.

<CodeGroup labels={[]}>

```javascript
import launcher from 'k6/x/browser';

export default function () {
  const browser = launcher.launch('chromium', { headless: false });
  const context = browser.newContext();
  const page = context.newPage();
  page.goto('http://whatsmyuseragent.org/');
  page.screenshot({ path: `example-chromium.png` });
  page.close();
  browser.close();
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Installation

xk6-browser is currently being developed as a [k6 extension](/extensions). You have to run a k6 version built with the browser extension to use the [browser-level APIs](#browser-level-apis) in your k6 tests.

### Download a release binary

The quickest way to get started is to [download a release binary from Github](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/releases).

### Build from source

If you're more adventurous or want to get the latest changes of xk6-browser, you can also build from source (just make sure you have a [Go toolchain](https://go101.org/article/go-toolchain.html) installed):

```bash
# install xk6
go install github.com/grafana/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest

# build the k6 binary
xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-browser
```

## Browser-level APIs

`xk6-browser` uses [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) to instrument and interact with the browser. The `xk6-browser` APIs aims for rough compatibility with the [Playwright API for NodeJS](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright). 

Note that because k6 does not run in NodeJS, `xk6-browser` APIs will slightly differ from their Playwright counterparts.

Here's a list of the fully (âœ…) or partially (ðŸš§) implemented classes of the Playwright API (with a more detailed breakdown of missing APIs in the table below):
