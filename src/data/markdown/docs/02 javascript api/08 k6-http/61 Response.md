Response is used by the http.\* methods that generate HTTP request. Those methods return one (or more, in the case of `http.batch()`) Response objects that contain HTTP response contents and performance timing measurements.

Note that in the case of redirects, all the information in the Response object will pertain to the last request (the one that doesn't get redirected).
