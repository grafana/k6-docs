Error codes, introduced in k6 0.24.0, are unique numbers that can be used to identify and handle different application and network errors more easily. For the moment, these error codes are applicable only for errors that happen during HTTP requests, but they will be reused and extended to support other protocols in future k6 releases.

When an error occurs, its code is determined and returned as both the `error_code` field of the [`http.Response`](/javascript-api/k6-http/response) object, and also attached as the `error_code` [tag](/using-k6/tags-and-groups) to any [metrics](/using-k6/metrics) associated with that request. Additionally, for more details, the `error` metric tag and `http.Response` field will still contain the actual string error message.

Error codes for different errors are as distinct as possible, but for easier handling and grouping, codes in different error categories are also grouped in broad ranges. The current error code ranges are:

- 1000-1099 - General errors
- 1100-1199 - DNS errors
- 1200-1299 - TCP errors
- 1300-1399 - TLS errors
- 1400-1499 - HTTP 4xx errors
- 1500-1599 - HTTP 5xx errors
- 1600-1699 - HTTP/2 specific errors

The following specific error codes are currently defined:

- 1000: A generic error that isn't any of the ones listed below.
- 1010: A non-TCP network error - this is a place holder there is no error currently known to trigger it.
- 1100: A generic DNS error that isn't any of the ones listed below.
- 1101: No IP for the provided host was found.
- 1110: Blacklisted IP was resolved or a connection to such was tried to be established.
- 1200: A generic TCP error that isn't any of the ones listed below.
- 1201: A "broken pipe" on write - the other side has likely closed the connection.
- 1202: An unknown TCP error - We got an error that we don't recognize but it is from the operating system and has `errno` set on it. The message in `error` includes the operation(write,read) and the errno, the OS, and the original message of the error.
- 1210: General TCP dial error.
- 1211: Dial timeout error - the timeout for the dial was reached.
- 1212: Dial connection refused - the connection was refused by the other party on dial.
- 1220: Reset by peer - the connection was reset by the other party, most likely a server.
- 1300: General TLS error
- 1310: Unknown authority - the certificate issuer is unknown.
- 1311: The certificate doesn't match the hostname.
- 1400 to 1499: error codes that correspond to the [HTTP 4xx status codes for client errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_errors)
- 1500 to 1599: error codes that correspond to the [HTTP 5xx status codes for server errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#5xx_Server_errors)
- 1600: A generic HTTP/2 error that isn't any of the ones listed below.
- 1610: A general HTTP/2 GoAway error.
- 1611 to 1629: HTTP/2 GoAway errors with the value of the specific [HTTP/2 error code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-7) added to 1611.
- 1630: A general HTTP/2 stream error.
- 1631 to 1649: HTTP/2 stream errors with the value of the specific [HTTP/2 error code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-7) added to 1631.
- 1650: A general HTTP/2 connection error.
- 1651 to 1669: HTTP/2 connection errors with the value of the specific [HTTP/2 error code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-7) added to 1651.
