Define constants to distinguish between [gRPC Response](/javascript-api/k6-experimental/grpc/response) statuses.

| Constant | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `StatusOK` | OK is returned on success. |
| `StatusCanceled` | Canceled indicates the operation was canceled (typically by the caller). |
| `StatusUnknown` | Unknown error. |
| `StatusInvalidArgument` | InvalidArgument indicates the client specified an invalid argument. |
| `StatusDeadlineExceeded` | DeadlineExceeded means operation expired before completion. |
| `StatusNotFound` | NotFound means some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found. |
| `StatusAlreadyExists` | AlreadyExists means an attempt to create an entity failed because one already exists. |
| `StatusPermissionDenied` | PermissionDenied indicates the caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. |
| `StatusResourceExhausted` | ResourceExhausted indicates some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. |
| `StatusFailedPrecondition` | FailedPrecondition indicates operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. |
| `StatusAborted` | Aborted indicates the operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue like sequencer check failures, transaction aborts, etc. |
| `StatusOutOfRange` | OutOfRange means operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or reading past end of file. |
| `StatusUnimplemented` | Unimplemented indicates operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled in this service. |
| `StatusInternal` | Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by the underlying system have been broken. |
| `StatusUnavailable` | Unavailable indicates the service is currently unavailable. This is a most likely a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry non-idempotent operations. |
| `StatusDataLoss` | DataLoss indicates unrecoverable data loss or corruption. |
| `StatusUnauthenticated` | Unauthenticated indicates the request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation. |

### Example

<CodeGroup labels={["grpc-test.js"]}>

```javascript
import grpc from 'k6/experimental/grpc';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

const client = new grpc.Client();
client.load(['definitions'], 'hello.proto');

export default () => {
  client.connect('grpcb.in:9001', {
    // plaintext: false
  });

  const data = { greeting: 'Bert' };
  const response = client.invoke('hello.HelloService/SayHello', data);

  check(response, {
    'status is OK': (r) => r && r.status === grpc.StatusOK,
  });

  client.close();
  sleep(1);
};
```
