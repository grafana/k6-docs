With this experimental module, you can _instrument_ HTTP requests so that they emit traces as the test runs.

## About trace contexts

A _trace context_ is a set of standardized HTTP headers added to a request that lets a tracing system correlate the request with other requests as they navigate through a system. The trace context specifications, such as the supported [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) and [Jaeger Trace Context](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.21/client-libraries/#propagation-format), define specific header names and an encoding format for the header values.

A trace context generally consists of, at least, a `trace_id`, a `span_id`, and a `sampled` flag. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier for the trace, the `span_id` is a unique identifier for the request, and the `sampled` flag is a boolean that indicates whether the request should be traced. For instance, the [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) defines the `Traceparent` header, whose value contains a `trace_id`, a `span_id` and a `sampled` flag, encoded as a dash (`-`) separated list of hexadecimal values. When a trace context header is attached to an HTTP request, we refer to it as being _propagated_ to the downstream service.

## Example

This example demonstrates how to use the tracing API to instrument every HTTP request made in a script with tracing information.

<CodeGroup labels={["example-tracing-module.js"]} lineNumbers={[]} showCopyButton={[true]}>

```javascript
import { check } from "k6";
import tracing from "k6/experimental/tracing";
import http from "k6/http";

// instrumentHTTP will ensure that all requests made by the http module
// from this point forward will have a trace context attached.
//
// The first argument is a configuration object that
// can be used to configure the tracer.
tracing.instrumentHTTP({
  // possible values: "w3c", "jaeger"
  propagator: "w3c",
});

export default () => {
  // the instrumentHTTP call in the init context replaced
  // the http module with a version that will automatically
  // attach a trace context to every request.
  //
  // Because the instrumentHTTP call was configured with the
  // w3c trace propagator, this request will as a result have
  // a `traceparent` header attached.
  const res = http.get("http://httpbin.org/get", {
    headers: {
      "X-Example-Header": "instrumented/get",
    },
  });
};
```
