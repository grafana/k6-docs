`SharedArray` is an array-like object that shares the underlying memory between VUs.
The function executes only once, and its result is saved in memory once.
When a script requests an element, k6 gives a _copy_ of that element.

You must construct a `SharedArray` in the [`init` context](/using-k6/test-lifecycle).
Its constructor takes a name for the `SharedArray` and a function that needs to return an array object itself:


```javascript
import { SharedArray } from 'k6/data';

const data = new SharedArray('some name', function () {
  const dataArray = [];
  // more operations
  return dataArray; // must be an array
});
```

The name argument is required.
VUs are completely separate JS VMs, and k6 needs some way to identify the `SharedArray` that it needs to return.
You can have multiple `SharedArrays` and even load only some of them for given VUs,
though this is unlikely to have any performance benefit.

Supported operations on a `SharedArray` include:
- Getting the number of elements with `length`
- Getting an element by its index using the normal syntax `array[index]`
- Using `for-of` loops

In most cases, you should be able to reduce the memory usage of an array data structure by wrapping it in a `SharedArray`.
Once constructed, a `SharedArray` is read-only, so **you can't use a SharedArray to communicate data between VUs**.

<Blockquote mod="attention" title="You can only construct a SharedArray in init code">

Attempting to instantiate a `SharedArray` outside of the [init context](/using-k6/test-lifecycle/) results in the exception `new SharedArray must be called in the init context`.

This limitation will eventually be removed, but for now, the implication is that you can use `SharedArray` to populate test data only at the very beginning of your test and not as a result of receiving data from a response (for example).

## Example

<CodeGroup labels={["example-SharedArray.js"]} lineNumbers={[]} showCopyButton={[true]}>

```javascript
import { SharedArray } from 'k6/data';

const data = new SharedArray('some name', function () {
  // All heavy work (opening and processing big files for example) should be done inside here.
  // This way it will happen only once and the result will be shared between all VUs, saving time and memory.
  const f = JSON.parse(open('./somefile.json'));
  return f; // f must be an array
});

export default function () {
  const element = data[Math.floor(Math.random() * data.length)];
  // do something with element
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Performance characteristics

Internally, the current implementation of `SharedArray` keeps the data marshaled as JSON and unmarshals elements only when they are requested.

In general, this operation should be unnoticeable (relative to whatever else you do with the data).
But, for small data sets, `SharedArray` might perform worse.
However, this is highly dependent on use case.

To test this, we ran the following script on version v0.31.0 with 100 VUs.

<CodeGroup labels={["shared-vs-unshared.js"]} lineNumbers={[]} showCopyButton={[true]}>

```javascript
import { check } from 'k6';
import http from 'k6/http';
import { SharedArray } from 'k6/data';

const n = parseInt(__ENV.N);
function generateArray() {
  const arr = new Array(n);
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    arr[i] = { something: 'something else' + i, password: '12314561' };
  }
  return arr;
}

let data;
if (__ENV.SHARED === 'true') {
  data = new SharedArray('my data', generateArray);
} else {
  data = generateArray();
}

export default function () {
  const iterationData = data[Math.floor(Math.random() * data.length)];
  const res = http.post('https://httpbin.test.k6.io/anything', JSON.stringify(iterationData), {
    headers: { 'Content-type': 'application/json' },
  });
  check(res, { 'status 200': (r) => r.status === 200 });
}
```

As the table shows, performance didn't differ much at lower numbers of data lines:
up until around 1000 data lines, `SharedArray` shows little benefit in memory usage
and had a higher upper bound of CPU usage (though not substantially higher).

At 10k lines and above, the memory savings started to heavily carry over to CPU savings as well.

| data lines | shared | wall time | CPU %    | MEM usage   | http requests |
| ---        | ---    | ---       | ---      |  ----       | ---           |
| 100        | true   | 2:01:70   | 70-79%   | 213-217MB   | 92191-98837   |
| 100        | false  | 2:01:80   | 74-75%   | 224-232MB   | 96851-98643   |
| 1000       | true   | 2:01:60   | 74-79%   | 209-216MB   | 98251-98806   |
| 1000       | false  | 2:01:90   | 75-77%   | 333-339MB   | 98069-98951   |
| 10000      | true   | 2:01:70   | 78-79%   | 213-217MB   | 97953-98735   |
| 10000      | false  | 2:03:00   | 80-83%   | 1364-1400MB | 96816-98852   |
| 100000     | true   | 2:02:20   | 78-79%   | 238-275MB   | 98103-98540   |
| 100000     | false  | 2:14:00   | 120-124% | 8.3-9.1GB   | 96003-97802   |

In v0.30.0, the difference in CPU usage at lower numbers was around 10-15%, but it also started to even out at around 10k data lines and was a clear winner at 100k.

The CPU/memory data came from using `/usr/bin/time`. Refer to the [gist with the raw data](https://gist.github.com/MStoykov/1181cfa6f00bc56b90915155f885e2bb).

These numbers are purely illustrative: the performance can be affected by any additional processing of the element retrieved from the `SharedArray`, or if an output is in use, or it gets multiple elements, etc.
While `SharedArray` has some CPU usage,
it might turn out to be negligible in a given situation with just 10 elements, or more problematic than the memory usage for a 100k elements.
So, if in doubt, you should probably run some benchmarks and decide which tradeoffs are more important for your use case.
