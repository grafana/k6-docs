---

The k6/grpc modules provides a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) client for Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) over HTTP/2.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [newClient()](/javascript-api/k6-grpc/newclient) | Creates a new [Client](/javascript-api/k6-grpc/client) that can be used to connect and make RPCs to a gRPC server. |

| Class/Method | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| [Client](/javascript-api/k6-grpc/client) | gRPC client used for making RPC calls to a gRPC Server |
| [Client.load(importPaths, ...protoFiles)](/javascript-api/k6-grpc/client/client-load-importpaths----protofiles) | Loads and parses the given protocol buffer definitions to be made available for RPC requests. |
| [Client.connect(address [,params])](/javascript-api/k6-grpc/client/client-connect-address-params) | Connects to a given gRPC service. |
| [Client.invokeRPC(url, request [,params])](/javascript-api/k6-grpc/client/client-invokerpc-url-request-params) | Makes a unary RPC for the given service/method and returns a [Response](/javascript-api/k6-grpc/response). |
| [Client.close()]() | Close the connection to the gRPC service. |
| [Params](/javascript-api/k6-grpc/params) | RPC Request specific options. |
| [Response](/javascript-api/k6-grpc/response) | Returned by RPC requests. |

| Constant | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `StatusOK` | OK is returned on success. |
| `StatusCanceled` | Canceled indicates the operation was canceled (typically by the caller). |
| `StatusUnknown` | Unknown error. |
| `StatusInvalidArgument` | InvalidArgument indicates client specified an invalid argument. |
| `StatusDeadlineExceeded` | DeadlineExceeded means operation expired before completion. |
| `StatusNotFound` | NotFound means some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found. |
| `StatusAlreadyExists` | AlreadyExists means an attempt to create an entity failed because one already exists. |
| `StatusPermissionDenied` | PermissionDenied indicates the caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. |
| `StatusResourceExhausted` | ResourceExhausted indicates some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. |
| `StatusFailedPrecondition` | FailedPrecondition indicates operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. |
| `StatusAborted` | Aborted indicates the operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue like sequencer check failures, transaction aborts, etc. |
| `StatusOutOfRange` | OutOfRange means operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or reading past end of file. |
| `StatusUnimplemented` | Unimplemented indicates operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled in this service. |
| `StatusInternal` | Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying system has been broken. If you see one of these errors, something is very broken. |
| `StatusUnavailable` | Unavailable indicates the service is currently unavailable. This is a most likely a transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with a backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry non-idempotent operations. |
| `StatusDataLoss` | DataLoss indicates unrecoverable data loss or corruption. |
| `StatusUnauthenticated` | Unauthenticated indicates the request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation. |
