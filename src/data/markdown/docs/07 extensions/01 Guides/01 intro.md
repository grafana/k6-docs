k6 extensions allow using functionality not supported natively in k6. They are standalone Go projects that can call internal Go APIs in k6 to provide new functionality.

Before k6 extensions, extending k6 with custom functionality that isn't available in the
open-source tool has been possible in one of two ways:

- By importing a JavaScript library. 
- By forking the [k6 repository](https://github.com/grafana/k6) and doing the changes in Go.

Both methods have some drawbacks: 

- A JavaScript library might be [incompatible or affect k6 performance](/using-k6/modules/#bundling-node-modules).
- k6 might not accept contributions if they don't align with the long-term vision. 

To address these issues and allow the community to adapt k6 to their needs, we released the [xk6 framework](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) and the concept of k6 extensions, providing the freedom to experiment with novel integrations with k6.


## What is xk6?

[xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) is a command-line tool and framework inspired by
[xcaddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy), designed for building custom k6
binaries that bundle one or more extensions written in Go.

Its main features are:

- Ease of use: with a few commands even less technical users should be able to build
  their own k6 binaries, given that they have the Go toolchain installed and any
  dependencies required by a specific extension.
- Simple API for Go programmers that handles the Go<->JS translation, with the
  ability to call any public k6 Go API. Extensions are first-class components along
  with other built-in modules.
- Cross-platform like Go and runs great on macOS, Windows and Linux.


## Extension types

The initial version of xk6 supported only JavaScript extensions, but since then we've
added support for Output extensions, and are considering expanding this to other
areas of k6 as well.

The currently supported extension types are:

#### JavaScript extension

These extensions enhance the k6 JavaScript API to add support for new network
protocols, achieve better performance than equivalent JS libraries, or implement
features that are unlikely to be made part of the k6 core.

Some examples include: [xk6-sql](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-sql),
[xk6-crypto](https://github.com/szkiba/xk6-crypto) and [xk6-file](https://github.com/avitalique/xk6-file).

```javascript
import sql from 'k6/x/sql';

const db = sql.open('sqlite3', './test.db');

export default function () {
  db.exec("INSERT INTO keyvalues (key, value) VALUES('lorem', 'ipsum');");
}
```


#### Output extension

While k6 has built-in support for many popular [output
backends](/getting-started/results-output/), this list will undoubtedly not be
exhaustive. Support for new systems and novel ways of handling the metric data
generated by k6 can be easily added with Output extensions. These receive metric
samples from k6, and are able to do any processing or further dispatching.

Some examples include: [xk6-output-kafka](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-output-kafka)
and [xk6-output-prometheus-remote](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-output-prometheus-remote).

```bash
K6_PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_URL=http://localhost:9090/api/v1/write ./k6 run script.js -o output-prometheus-remote
```

## Supported k6 execution modes

k6 extensions work for local execution, i.e. running a
script with a k6 binary built by xk6 on your own infrastructure. The [k6 Kubernetes operator](https://github.com/grafana/k6-operator#using-extensions) also supports custom k6 binaries with extensions.

In [k6 Cloud](/cloud/), only supported k6 extensions are available for Enterprise customers. 

For all k6 Cloud users, it is possible to run a binary built with xk6 and send metrics produced by extension code to the Cloud using the [`cloud` output](/results-visualization/cloud/).
