### Advanced JavaScript Extension

The extension(s) you are using need to be upgraded if you're encountering a warning like the following:

```bash
WARN[0000] Module 'k6/x/...' is using deprecated APIs that will be removed in k6 v0.38.0, for more details on how to update it see https://k6.io/docs/extensions/guides/create-an-extension/#advanced-javascript-extension
```

Refer to the updated documentation for creating [JavaScript Extensions](/extensions/getting-started/create/javascript-extensions/#advanced-module-api).
