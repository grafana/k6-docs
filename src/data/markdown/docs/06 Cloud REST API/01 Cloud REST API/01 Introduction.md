Welcome to the k6 Cloud API reference documentation. 

This documentation should be of interest to anyone who wishes to use or build upon the k6 Cloud platform. This API gives you programmatic access to the same set of features used to power the service at [app.k6.io](https://app.k6.io). 

In practice, this means you can start tests, retrieve details of tests, and more.

If you find an API endpoint that you would like to use and is not documented here, please contact us. Most Public API endpoints are not listed, but we are happy to continue to document them as needed.
