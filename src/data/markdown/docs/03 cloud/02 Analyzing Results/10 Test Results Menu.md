After you analyze your test, you might want to mark it for further analysis.

To do this, you have a few options:
- Save the test, keeping it beyond normal data retention periods.
- Make notes on the test, preserving contextual details.
- Export it to another format, so you can query it with the program of your choice.
- Make a shareable link, so you can show the results to others.
- Delete irrelevant tests, de-cluttering your UI.

To do any of these actions, use the vertical-dots icon to open the *Test Result menu*.

## Save a test result

Besides [saving a test as a baseline](/cloud/analyzing-results/test-comparison), you can also save a test to persist its data.

> â“˜ **Each premium k6 Cloud subscription can save some number of test results indefinitely.**
>
> Your subscription level determines how many tests you can save.

To save a test run, follow these steps:
1. Use the three-dot icon in the top-right corner of your test run.
2. Select **Save test result**.

After you save a test, k6 adds the test to one of the available slots.

If you need to open up a slot for a new test to save, you can remove an old test.
To remove a test, follow these steps:

1. On the side menu, head to **Manage > Saved tests**.
2. Select the test to unsave.
3. Select the three-dot icon, then **Remove safe status**.

Unlike setting a baseline, saved tests can have more than one test run.

## Create a note

The **Create Note** option launches a modal window with a text box.

You can write comments about the test, mark changes, or add any context worth noting.

## Generate a PDF summary

Generates an executive summary of the test's most relevant metrics and performance data.

Refer to [Export Results](/cloud/analyzing-results/result-export#generate-pdf-report).

## Export data

Starts a data export.

Refer to [Export results](/cloud/analyzing-results/result-export#export-as-csv).

## Share test results

Generates a URL that you can use to share test results.

**Users don't need to authenticate to view a shared test URL**.
If you want to share sensitive results, consider adding users as
[Members](/cloud/project-and-team-management/members) instead.
