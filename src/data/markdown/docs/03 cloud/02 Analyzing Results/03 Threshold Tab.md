## Cloud Results: Thresholds

The Threshold Tab allow you to visually inspect and analyze `Thresholds` in your test. The number in the tab represents passing Thresholds / Total Thresholds so you can quickly see if something needs your attention.

Further within this tab, you are able to:

- Easily see failing checks. In the example below, our `check_failure_rate` custom metric is failing. Take notice of the &#10003; or &#10005; on the left side of each row.
- Expand a threshold to view it's graph. In our example below, the expanded threshold is below the threshold of 100 ms
- Add the chart to the `Analysis Tab` for further correlation with other data
