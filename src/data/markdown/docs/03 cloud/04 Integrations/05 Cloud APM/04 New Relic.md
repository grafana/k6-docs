excerpt: 'How to export metrics from k6 Cloud to New Relic'
---

With this integration, you can export test result metrics from the k6 Cloud to the [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) data platform.

> ⭐️  &nbsp;[Cloud APM](/cloud/integrations/cloud-apm/) integrations are available on Pro and Enterprise plans, as well as the annual Team plan and Trial.

## Set up Prometheus remote write integration in New Relic

With New Relic, you can set up a Prometheus remote write instance to collect data.
k6 Cloud can export test-result metrics to this Prometheus instance to flow data into New Relic.

### Necessary New Relic settings

To set up the New Relic integration for k6 Cloud, you need the following settings from New Relic:

- License Key
- Prometheus remote write URL

The integration needs a [New Relic license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key) to authenticate and authorize k6 metrics for ingestion.

Once you have the license key, launch a Prometheus instance and set up the remote write integration in New Relic.
To do this, follow the [New Relic instructions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration/).

## Export k6 Cloud metrics to New Relic

You must enable the New Relic integration for each test whose results you want to export.

After you set up the New Relic settings in the test, you can run a cloud test as usual.
As the test runs, the k6 Cloud continuously sends the test-result metrics to New Relic.

Currently, there are two options to set up the Cloud APM settings in the test:

- [Using the test builder](#configuration-using-the-test-builder)
- [Scripting the k6 test](#configuration-in-the-k6-script)


### Export to New Relic with the test builder

First, you have to configure the New Relic integration for an organization.

1. From the Main navigation, go to **Manage > Cloud APM** and select **New Relic**.

1. In this form, enter the URL and license key that you copied previously from New Relic.

  For more information on the other input fields, see [configuration parameters](#configuration-parameters).

1. Save the New Relic configuration for the current organization.

Note that configuring New Relic settings for an organization does not enable the integration.
You must enable it manually for each test using the [test builder](/test-authoring/test-builder).

1. Create a new test with the test builder, or select a test that was already created with the Test Builder.

1. On the test builder sidebar, select the **Cloud APM** to enable the integration for the test.

### Export to New Relic in a k6 script

If you script your k6 tests,
you can configure the Cloud APM settings using the `apm` option in the k6 script.

The parameters to export k6 metrics to New Relic are as follows:

```javascript
export const options = {
  ext: {
    loadimpact: {
      apm: [
        {
          provider: 'prometheus',
          remoteWriteURL:
            'https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=<YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME>',

          // optional when `remoteWriteURL` includes the `X-License-Key` query param
          credentials: {
            token: '<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>',
          },

          // optional parameters
          metrics: ['http_req_sending', 'my_rate', 'my_gauge'], // ...
          includeDefaultMetrics: true,
          includeTestRunId: false,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

<Blockquote mod="warning" title="keepTags can have a high cost">

Most cloud platforms charge clients based on the number of time series stored.

When exporting a metric, every combination of kept-tag values becomes a distinct time series in Prometheus.
While this granularity can help test analysis, it will incur high costs with thousands of time series.

For example, if you add `keepTags: ["name"]` on `http_*` metrics, and your load test calls many dynamic URLs, the number of produced time series can build up very quickly.
Refer to [URL Grouping](/using-k6/http-requests#url-grouping) for how to reduce the value count for a `name` tag.

k6 recommends exporting only tags that are necessary and don't have many distinct values.

    loadimpact: {
      apm: [
        {
          // ...
          includeDefaultMetrics: false,
          includeTestRunId: true,

          metrics: [
            // keep vus metrics for whole test run
            'vus',
            // total byte count for data sent/received by k6
            'data_sent',
            'data_received',

            // export checks metric, keeping 'check' (name of the check) tag
            {
              sourceMetric: 'checks',
              keepTags: ['check'],
            },

            // export HTTP durations from 'default' scenario,
            // keeping only successful response codes (2xx, 3xx), using regex selector syntax
            {
              sourceMetric: 'http_req_duration{scenario="default",status=~"[23][0-9]{2}"}',
              targetMetric: 'k6_http_request_duration', // name of metric as it appears in New Relic
              keepTags: ['name', 'method', 'status'],
            },

            // count HTTP responses with status 500
            {
              sourceMetric: 'http_reqs{status="500"}',
              targetMetric: 'k6_http_server_errors_count',
