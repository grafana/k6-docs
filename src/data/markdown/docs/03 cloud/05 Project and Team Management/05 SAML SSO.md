## What is SAML?

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an Identity Provider (e.g. Azure AD, Okta) and a Service Provider (i.e. k6 Cloud). SAML SSO eases provisioning, management and access of users from a single identity provider to multiple service providers.

k6 Cloud makes use of SAML single sign-on (SSO) to facilitate provisioning of new users, and giving them leveled access to various organization(s) and projects.

> __Note__
>
> The SAML 2.0 standard allows k6 Cloud to work with practically any SAML 2.0 identity provider, not just the ones documented here.

## IdP and SP setup and user provisioning

To setup SAML SSO for your organization, some requirements should be satisfied and some steps should be taken on your IdP and on k6 Cloud. Assuming you already have admin access to your IdP and the k6 Cloud, this is the checklist to enable SAML SSO for your organization on k6 Cloud:

1. Install or setup the SAML SSO application on your IdP.
2. Provide the "IdP Metadata URL" to the customer success team.
3. Update the application on the IdP with the provided token from the customer success team.
4. Optionally request to enforce SAML SSO on all existing and new users. This effectively disables username/password authentication for all users, even the owner.
5. Assign users to the IdP application.
6. Optionally choose default projects for newly provisioned users to land in on k6 Cloud.
7. Users can now be provisioned to k6 Cloud web app once they have access to and click on the application icon on their IdP dashboard.
8. Once the user is provisioned (created and joined to the correct organization/project on k6 Cloud), they can use both IdP- and SP-initiated to sign in. This means that in addition to the clicking on the k6 Cloud application on their IdP dashboard, the user can also use SAML SSO button available on the k6 Cloud web app.

> ⚠️ __Invite users via k6 Cloud web app doesn't work with SAML SSO__
>
> Once SAML SSO is enabled on the k6 Cloud for your organization, you must not invite team members through the k6 Cloud web app, rather they should use these following methods to be provisioned and to sign in:
>
> - Username/password and SAML SSO (mixed):<br/>
>   This is limited to the owner and the users created in advance via invitation with username/password.
> - SAML SSO:<br/>
>   All new users should be solely created via SAML SSO provisioning.
>
> 💡 __What is SAML SSO provisioning?__
>
> SAML SSO provisioning is the first time a user signs in to k6 Cloud web app via SAML SSO from their IdP dashboard. This process causes the user to be created, joined to its organization and assigned to the default project(s). After this process the user can use IdP- and SP-initiated SAML SSO.

## Supported IdPs

Currently the following IdPs are tested and supported. The setup instructions for each of them are provided on their own page.

- [Azure Active Directory](/cloud/project-and-team-management/saml-sso/azure-ad)
- [Okta](/cloud/project-and-team-management/saml-sso/okta)

## Unsupported IdPs

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is tested, but not supported, because it can't map [custom attributes](https://community.auth0.com/t/adding-custom-saml-attribute-when-auth0-is-idp/45691) in assertions.

## Assigning default project(s) to newly provisioned users

When new users are provisioned into k6 Cloud, they automatically join your organization and will be assigned the default project of your organization. You can change these default settings and choose which projects to assign to newly provisioned users.

It is recommended to update the list of projects before any new users are provisioned, so that you can assign them to pre-defined projects. Please note that this feature doesn't work retroactively, that is, already existing (provisioned) users on k6 Cloud won't be affected by this change.

Follow these steps to update list of default projects for new users:

1. Make sure you correctly setup the SAML organization with the help of the customer success team. You can use your admin account to test the setup.
2. Go to your organization setting and choose the SAML SSO tab:
![SAML SSO settings](images/04-SAML-SSO/saml-sso-settings.png)
As you can see below, the default project is already selected:
![SAML SSO default project](images/04-SAML-SSO/saml-sso-default-project.png)
3. From the drop-down you can choose the default project(s) newly provisioned users will be assigned, then click on update button:
![SAML SSO update default projects](images/04-SAML-SSO/saml-sso-update-default-project.png)
4. Now the users assigned to the IdP application can sign in to k6 Cloud and they'll be automatically added to the specified project(s) in step 3 with __project read/write__ permissions.

## Auto-assigning your internal teams to k6 projects

With _Teams_, you can automatically assign all members of your internal teams (aka. [Okta](/cloud/project-and-team-management/saml-sso/okta) and [Azure Active Directory](/cloud/project-and-team-management/saml-sso/azure-ad) groups) to one or more [k6 Cloud projects](/cloud/project-and-team-management/projects/).

Setting up teams has two steps:

1. You, or whomever the IdP organization admin is, should organize your internal teams into Okta/Azure _groups_. Make sure to give those groups access to the `k6 Cloud` application. Next they should update attribute statement on the said application to relay the group name in the call to our platform upon sign-in.
2. Since mapping your teams to k6 projects is currently a manual process, you need to reach out to us via the Customer Success team for further setup. We will ask you for the attribute name you used to pass the group name to us. Group names will become project names. Upon the first sign-in from any user of any group, the project will be automatically created. Any other user will be joined to the already created project.

Each IdP platform has its own instructions for setting up groups, which are provided in their corresponding documentation:

- [Azure Active Directory](/cloud/project-and-team-management/saml-sso/azure-ad#teams-setup)
- [Okta](/cloud/project-and-team-management/saml-sso/okta#teams-setup)
