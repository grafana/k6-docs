<b>VAT for EU Organizations</b>

If you are making a purchase from within the EU, please be sure to enter your VAT number before purchase.

If you do not enter a VAT number, we must collect VAT and we're unable to refund VAT even if you present a valid number later on.

Due to regulations, all purchases made within Sweden will include VAT.
