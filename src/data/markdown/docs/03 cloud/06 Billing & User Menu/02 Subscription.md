## Background

The subscription menu gives you a simple view of your current plan's limits and how many tests remain for your current period.

## Your Subscription

Provides details about your current active subscription and any add-ons you may have. Note the counter in the right corner displaying usage for the current period of your subscription.

## Upgrades

If you've paid online with a credit card, you can upgrade at any time. We will prorate your existing subscription towards the cost of a new one.

## Downgrades

To downgrade your subscription, select a new plan at any time. We will bill the new cost immediately and start the new plan at the end of your current period.

## Cancelation / Data Retention

You may cancel your online subscription at any time through the web app. When canceling, you can opt into [Data Retention](/cloud/billing-user-menu/data-retention) to save your result data longer-term or between projects. If you don't choose data retention, k6 clears all test-result data seven days after your subscription expires. When canceling, you can use your plan through the end of the current period.
