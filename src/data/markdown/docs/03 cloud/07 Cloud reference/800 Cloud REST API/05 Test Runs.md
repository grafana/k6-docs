title: 'Test Runs'
excerpt: ''
---

A _load test run_ is an individual execution of a load test.
Every test run has an ID, held in an array of `test_run_ids` in the `k6-test` object.

## Start load test run

Starts a test run in k6 Cloud for the specified Load Test ID. 

> Note that this endpoint uses the `/v2/tests/` base URL rather than `/v2/runs`. It also needs to be provided with a Load Test `{id}`. This is because this endpoint makes use of the data from the provided Load Test to create and return a new Load Test Run.

The test run is managed by k6 Cloud from beginning to end.
You can monitor the test progress in the k6 Cloud application.
From there, you can also export and analyze the result.

**POST** `https://api.k6.io/loadtests/v2/tests/{id}/start-testrun`

| Path Parameter | Type    | Description                                   |
| -------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| id             | integer | A unique integer value identifying this test. |

## Read load test run

Returns details of a test run with the specified ID.
The response contains several fields about test-run status.

The `run_status` field describes how far the test run is in the execution pipeline.
Possible values are the following:

| Value | Description                                                                                                                   |

## Stop load test run

Manually stops a load test run. If you follow along in the app, the test-run will be marked as `Aborted (by User)`. Note that can take a few moments before the test actually stops as the processor shuts down.

**POST** `/loadtests/v2/runs/{id}/stop`
