excerpt: 'Your entire organization’s thresholds in one place'

You can track and manage all your organization’s thresholds.
You can easily find tests with failing thresholds, check which project they belong to, their current status and history, and whether patterns need your attention.

To manage thresholds, under **Manage** in the sidebar, select **Thresholds**.

![Full UI](images/Thresholds/full-ui.png)

The **Thresholds** page has a few sections:

**Filtering section (highlighted in green)**<br/>
This is where you can narrow down the results by filtering by: `Projects`, `Status` and `Period`.

**Overview section (highlighted in blue)**<br/>
In this section you see the overview numbers of all your organization's thresholds.

**Threshold listing (highlighted yellow)**<br/>
Here are the thresholds and their accompanying data.
