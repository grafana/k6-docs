<b>VAT for EU Organizations</b>

If you purchase from within the EU, be sure to enter your value-added tax (VAT) ID number **before purchase**.

If you do not enter a VAT number, we must collect VAT,
and we cannot refund VAT even if you present a valid number later.

Regulations require that all purchases in Sweden include VAT.
