[xk6-disruptor](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-disruptor) is an extension that adds fault injection capabilities to k6.

It provides a Javascript [API](/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/api) to inject [faults](/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/api/faults/) such as errors and delays into HTTP and gRPC requests served by selected Kubernetes [Pods](/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/api/poddisruptor) or [Services](/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/api/servicedisruptor).


```javascript
export default function () {
    // Create a new disruptor that targets a service
    const disruptor = new ServiceDisruptor("app-service","app-namespace");

    // Disrupt the targets by injecting delays and faults into HTTP request for 30 seconds
    const fault = {
        averageDelay: '500ms',
        errorRate: 0.1,
        errorCode: 500
    }
    disruptor.injectHTTPFaults(fault, "30s")
}
```
