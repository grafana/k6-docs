[xk6-disruptor](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-disruptor) is an extension that adds fault injection capabilities to k6. It implements the principles of the Chaos Engineering discipline to test the reliability of our applications under turbulent conditions such as latency delays and response errors. Key features include:

- Everything as code. Facilitate test reuse without learning a new DSL.

- Fast to adopt with no day-two surprises. [No need to deploy and maintain](/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/explanations/how-xk6-disruptor-works/) a fleet of agents or operators.

- Easy to extend and integrate with other types of k6 tests. No need to try to glue multiple tools together to get the job done.

## Capabilities

Currently, the disruptor is intended to test systems running in Kubernetes. Other platforms are not supported at this time.

It provides a Javascript API that can create [PodDisruptors](javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/api/poddisruptor) and [ServiceDisruptors](/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/api/servicedisruptor) to inject different [faults](/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/api/faults/) in HTTP and gRPC responses, such as errors and delays, into the selected Kubernetes Pods or Services. 

Other types of faults and disruptors will be introduced in the future.
The [Roadmap](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-disruptor/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) presents the project's goals for the coming months regarding new functionalities and enhancements.

```javascript
export default function () {
    // Create a new pod disruptor with a selector
    // that matches pods from the "default" namespace with the label "app=my-app"
    const disruptor = new PodDisruptor({
        namespace: "default",
        select: { labels: { app: "my-app" } },
    });

    // Check that there is at least one target
    const targets = disruptor.targets();
    if (targets.length != 1) {
        throw new Error("expected list to have one target");
    }

    // Disrupt the targets by injecting HTTP faults into them for 30 seconds
    const fault = {
        averageDelay: 500,
        errorRate: 0.1,
        errorCode: 500
    }
    disruptor.injectHTTPFaults(fault, "30s")
}
```


## Use cases

The main use case for xk6-disruptor is to test the resiliency of an application of diverse types of disruptions by reproducing their effects without reproducing their root causes. For example, inject delays in the HTTP requests an application makes to a service without having to stress or interfere with the infrastructure (network, nodes) on which the service runs or affect other workloads in unexpected ways.

In this way, the disruptor makes reliability tests repeatable and predictable while limiting their blast radius. These are essential characteristics to incorporate these tests in the test suits of applications deployed on shared infrastructures such as staging environments.

## Learn more

Check the [requirements](/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/requirements/), [installation](/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/installation/), and [how to expose your application](/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/expose-your-application/) to get started with the disruptor.

This documentation presents a few [examples of injecting faults in different scenarios](/javascript-api/xk6-disruptor/examples/).

Also, an [interactive demo environment in Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/grafana-xk6-disruptor/scenario/killercoda) is available to use the k6 disruptor right away. You can fail the services of a demo application without having to install Kubernetes on your local machine.
