title: "Track transmitted data per URL"
excerpt: "This example shows how to track data sent and received for a individual URL."

By default, k6 collects automatically two [built-in metrics](/using-k6/metrics#built-in-metrics) related to the transmitted data during the test execution:

- `data_received`:  the amount of received data.
- `data_sent`: the amount of data sent. 

However, the reported values of these metrics don't tag the particular request or URL. Therefore, you cannot know the amount of data transmitted for a specific request or URL.

This example shows how to track data sent and received for an individual URL.


<div class="code-group" data-props='{ "labels": [""], "lineNumbers": [true] }'>

```js
import http from "k6/http";
import { sleep } from "k6";
import { Counter } from "k6/metrics";

// Two custom metrics to track data sent and received. We will tag data points added with the corresponding URL
// so we can filter these metrics down to see the data for individual URLs and set threshold across all or per-URL as well.
export let epDataSent = new Counter("endpoint_data_sent");
export let epDataRecv = new Counter("endpoint_data_recv");

export let options = {
    duration: '10s',
    vus: 10,
    thresholds: {
        // We can setup thresholds on these custom metrics, "count" means bytes in this case.
        "endpoint_data_sent": ["count < 2048"],

        // The above threshold would look at all data points added to the custom metric.
        // If we want to only consider data points for a particular URL/endpoint we can filter by URL.
        "endpoint_data_sent{url:https://test.k6.io/contacts.php}": ["count < 1024"],
        "endpoint_data_recv{url:https://test.k6.io/}": ["count < 2048"] // "count" means bytes in this case
    }
};

function sizeOfHeaders(hdrs) {
    return Object.keys(hdrs).reduce((sum, key) => sum + key.length + hdrs[key].length, 0);
}

function trackDataMetricsPerURL(res) {
    // Add data points for sent and received data
    epDataSent.add(sizeOfHeaders(res.request.headers) + res.request.body.length, { url: res.url });
    epDataRecv.add(sizeOfHeaders(res.headers) + res.body.length, { url: res.url });
}

export default function() {
    let res;

    res = http.get("https://test.k6.io/");
    trackDataMetricsPerURL(res);

    res = http.get("https://test.k6.io/contacts.php");
    trackDataMetricsPerURL(res);

    sleep(1);
};
```

</div>
