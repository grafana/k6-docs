> This feature is new as of version 0.27.0. Usage of this feature is optional and for the vast majority of users,
> existing scripts and configurations will continue to work as before. For a list of breaking changes,
> see the [k6 v0.27.0 release notes](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/releases/tag/v0.27.0).

Scenarios allow us to make in-depth configurations to how VUs and iterations are scheduled, allowing
k6 scenarios enable configuring how VUs and iterations are scheduled, making it possible to model diverse traffic patterns in load tests. Benefits of using scenarios include:

- Multiple scenarios can be declared in the same script, and each one can
  independently execute a different JavaScript function, which makes organizing tests easier
  and more flexible.
- Every scenario can use a distinct VU and iteration scheduling pattern,
  powered by a purpose-built [executor](#executors). This enables modeling
  of advanced execution patterns which can better simulate real-world traffic.
- They can be configured to run in sequence or parallel, or in any mix of the two.
- Different environment variables and metric tags can be set per scenario.

## Configuration

Execution scenarios are primarily configured via the `scenarios` key of the exported `options` object
in your test scripts. The key for each scenario can be an arbitrary, but unique, scenario name. It will
appear in the result summary, tags, etc.

<CodeGroup labels={[]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```js
export let options = {
  scenarios: {
    example_scenario: {
      // name of the executor to use
      executor: 'shared-iterations',

      // common scenario configuration
      startTime: '10s',
      gracefulStop: '5s',
      env: { EXAMPLEVAR: 'testing' },
      tags: { example_tag: 'testing' },

      // executor-specific configuration
      vus: 10,
      iterations: 200,
      maxDuration: '10s',
    },
    another_scenario: { ... }
  }
}
```

## Executors

[Executors](/using-k6/scenarios/executors) are the workhorses of the k6 execution engine. Each one schedules VUs and iterations differently, and you'll choose one depending on the type
of traffic you want to model to test your services.

Possible values for `executor` are the executor name separated by hyphens.
