Out of the box k6 comes with support for the following protocols:

* HTTP/1.1
* [HTTP/2](/using-k6/protocols/http-2)
* [WebSockets](/using-k6/protocols/websockets)
* [gRPC](/using-k6/protocols/grpc)

k6 will use HTTP/1.1 by default when it contacts a server. If, after connection, the server
reports to k6 that it supports [HTTP/2](/using-k6/protocols/http-2), k6 will upgrade the
connection to HTTP/2 instead. This is all automatic - both the use of HTTP/1.1 initially and
the potential protocol upgrade, and you don't have to do anything special when using k6 to
enable either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. You might want to verify which protocol is actually being
used for a transaction though, which requires an extra step.

[WebSockets](/using-k6/protocols/websockets) is a little bit different, the structure of the
test and the VU lifecycle is different.

k6 v0.29.0 introduced [xk6](https://k6.io/blog/extending-k6-with-xk6) allowing the community 
to build k6 extensions and therefore add support for additional protocols. 

k6 community contributed extensions for SQL, Kafka, ZeroMQ, Redis, and other protocols.
