title: 'Executors'
---

[Executors](/using-k6/scenarios/executors) are the workhorses of the k6 execution engine. Each one
schedules VUs and iterations differently, and you'll choose one depending on the type of traffic you
want to model to test your services.

Possible values for `executor` are the executor name separated by hyphens.

| Name                                                                         | Value                   | Description                                                                                                                                        |

| [Shared iterations](/using-k6/scenarios/executors/shared-iterations)         | `shared-iterations`     | A fixed amount of iterations are<br/> "shared" between a number of VUs.                                                                            |
| [Per VU iterations](/using-k6/scenarios/executors/per-vu-iterations)         | `per-vu-iterations`     | Each VU executes an exact number of iterations.                                                                                                    |
| [Constant VUs](/using-k6/scenarios/executors/constant-vus)                   | `constant-vus`          | A fixed number of VUs execute as many<br/> iterations as possible for a specified amount of time.                                                  |
| [Ramping VUs](/using-k6/scenarios/executors/ramping-vus)                     | `ramping-vus`           | A variable number of VUs execute as many<br/> iterations as possible for a specified amount of time.                                               |
| [Constant Arrival Rate](/using-k6/scenarios/executors/constant-arrival-rate) | `constant-arrival-rate` | A fixed number of iterations are executed<br/> in a specified period of time.                                                                      |
| [Ramping Arrival Rate](/using-k6/scenarios/executors/ramping-arrival-rate)   | `ramping-arrival-rate`  | A variable number of iterations are <br/> executed in a specified period of time.                                                                  |
| [Externally Controlled](/using-k6/scenarios/executors/externally-controlled) | `externally-controlled` | Control and scale execution at runtime<br/> via [k6's REST API](/misc/k6-rest-api) or the [CLI](https://k6.io/blog/how-to-control-a-live-k6-test). |
