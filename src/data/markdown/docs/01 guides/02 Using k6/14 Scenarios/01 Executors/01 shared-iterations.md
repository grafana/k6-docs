title: 'Shared iterations'
excerpt: ''

## Description

A fixed number of iterations are "shared" between a number of VUs, and the test ends once all iterations are executed. This executor is equivalent to the global [vus](/using-k6/options#vus) and [iterations](/using-k6/options#iterations) shortcut options.

Note that iterations aren't fairly distributed with this executor, and a VU that executes faster will complete more iterations than others. If you want guarantees that every VU will complete a specific, fixed number of iterations, [use the per-VU iterations executor](/using-k6/scenarios/executors/per-vu-iterations).

## Options

In addition to the [common configuration options](/using-k6/scenarios#common-options) this executor
also adds the following options:

| Option        | Type    | Description                                                                        | Default |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `vus`         | integer | Number of VUs to run concurrently.                                                 | `1`     |
| `iterations`  | integer | Total number of script iterations to execute across all VUs.                       | `1`     |
| `maxDuration` | string  | Maximum scenario duration before it's forcibly stopped (excluding `gracefulStop`). | `"10m"` |

### When to use

This executor is suitable when you want a specific amount of VUs to complete a fixed
number of total iterations, and the amount of iterations per VU is not important.

## Example

In this example, we'll execute 200 total iterations shared by 10 VUs with a maximum duration of 10 seconds
