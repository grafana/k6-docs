## Questions and discussions

The [community forum](https://community.k6.io/) is the primary support channel of the
k6 community. Itâ€™s the place to discuss features, recommendations and support type of
questions.

Use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/k6) to ask code-level questions or if you
encountered a particular error. Start out by searching using the `k6` tag, and if
you find no prior answers, just create a new question using the `k6` and `load-testing` tags.

## Feature Requests and Ideas

The [community forum](https://community.k6.io/) is a great place for discussions. Open
a conversation if you want to discuss a rough idea, features, architecture and best
practices.

If you already have a well-formulated idea of your feature request, we recommend filing
a new issue, if there isnâ€™t an open one already.

Please search that it hasnâ€™t previously reported.

If you have found a bug on this documentation site, please let us know in the `#documentation`

  code. We have issues labeled as good first issue that have a limited scope.
- Blog about k6. Contact us on [Slack](https://k6.io/slack/) if you would like your post to
