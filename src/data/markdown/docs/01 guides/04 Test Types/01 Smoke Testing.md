Smoke test is a regular load test, configured for minimal load.
You want to run a smoke test as a sanity check every time you write a new script or modify an existing script.

You want to run a smoke test to:

1.  Verify that your test script doesn't have errors.
2.  Verify that your system doesn't throw any errors when under minimal load.

## Smoke testing in k6

Here's a relatively simple smoke test script to get you started. You can copy it, change a few URLs and start testing in no time.
If you would like to see more comprehensive script, check out our [example section](/examples).

<CodeGroup labels={["sample-smoke-test.js"]} lineNumbers={[true]}>

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, group, sleep, fail } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  vus: 1, // 1 user looping for 1 minute
  duration: '1m',

  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(99)<1500'], // 99% of requests must complete below 1.5s
  },
};

const BASE_URL = 'https://test-api.k6.io';
const USERNAME = 'TestUser';
const PASSWORD = 'SuperCroc2020';

export default () => {
  let loginRes = http.post(`${BASE_URL}/auth/token/login/`, {
    username: USERNAME,
    password: PASSWORD,
  });

  check(loginRes, {
    'logged in successfully': (resp) => resp.json('access') !== '',
  });

  let authHeaders = {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${loginRes.json('access')}`,
    },
  };

  let myObjects = http.get(`${BASE_URL}/my/crocodiles/`, authHeaders).json();
  check(myObjects, { 'retrieved crocodiles': (obj) => obj.length > 0 });

  sleep(1);
};
```

The VU chart of a smoke test should look similar to this. You want to use only 1 or 2 VUs.

If your smoke test produced any errors, you must either correct the script or fix your environment
before you can continue.

The k6 output should look similar to this:
![Smoke test Terminal Output](./images/smoke-test-terminal-output.png)

Once your smoke test shows 0 errors, as on the screenshot above, you can go to the next step and execute a [load test](/test-types/load-testing) to assess the performance of your system.
