`toBeBetween(from, to)` is a comparison function that evaluates to true or false. It must be called in the chain after the `t.expect(value)` or `.and(value)`. 

`toBeBetween(from, to)` is equivalent to `value >= from && value <= to`

When `toBeBetween(from, to)` evaluates to false, the chain is broken, and the test case is marked as failed. When the chain is broken, further checks inside of the `test` are omitted.

### Example

<CodeGroup labels={[]}>

```javascript
import { describe } from 'https://jslib.k6.io/expect/0.0.4/index.js';
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function testSuite() {
  describe('Basic API test', (t) => {
    const response = http.get('https://test-api.k6.io/public/crocodiles');

    t.expect(response.status).as('response status').toBeBetween(200, 299);
  });
}
```

</CodeGroup>

When you run this test with `k6 run mytest.js` the result should look similar to this:

```
█ Basic API test
  ✓ response status is between 200 - 299
```
