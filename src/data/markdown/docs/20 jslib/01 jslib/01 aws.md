The `aws` module is a JavaScript library that wraps around some Amazon AWS services API. 

The library exposes a couple of configuration and client classes allowing to interact with a subset of AWS services in the context of k6 load test scripts:
- [S3Client](/javascript-api/jslib/aws/s3client): a class to list S3 buckets and the objects they contain, as well as uploading, downloading and deleting objects from them.
- [SecretsManagerClient](/javascript-api/jslib/aws/secretsmanagerclient): a class to list, get, create, update, and delete secrets from the AWS secrets manager service.
- [KMSClient](/javascript-api/jslib/aws/kmsclient): a class to list and generate keys from the AWS Key Management Service.
- [SystemsManagerClient](/javascript-api/jslib/aws/systemsmanagerclient): a class to fetch parameters from the AWS Systems Manager Service.
- [AWSConfig](/javascript-api/jslib/aws/awsconfig/): a class is used by each client classes to provide them access to AWS credentials as well as configuration.

#### This library is in active development

This library is stable enough to be useful, but pay attention to the new versions released on [jslib.k6.io](https://jslib.k6.io) and [k6-jslib-aws/releases](https://github.com/grafana/k6-jslib-aws/releases).   

This documentation is for the last version only. If you discover that some code below does not work, it most likely means that you are using an older version.
